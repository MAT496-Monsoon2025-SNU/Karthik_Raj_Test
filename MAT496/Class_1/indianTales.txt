Batten","","[Illustration:]","","","","","","","London","David Nutt, 270, 271 Strand","1892","","","","","_Only One Hundred and Sixty Copies of this","Edition on Japanese Vellum Paper have been printed,","of which One Hundred and Fifty are for Sale.","","This is No. 147_","","","_The Illustrations in this Book were coloured by hand by","Miss Gloria Cardew._","","","","","   _TO","   MY DEAR LITTLE PHIL_","","","","","Preface","","","From the extreme West of the Indo-European world, we go this year to","the extreme East. From the soft rain and green turf of Gaeldom, we","seek the garish sun and arid soil of the Hindoo. In the Land of Ire,","the belief in fairies, gnomes, ogres and monsters is all but dead; in","the Land of Ind it still flourishes in all the vigour of animism.","","Soils and national characters differ; but fairy tales are the same in","plot and incidents, if not in treatment. The majority of the tales in","this volume have been known in the West in some form or other, and the","problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in","farthest West and East. Some--as Benfey in Germany, M. Cosquin in","France, and Mr. Clouston in England--have declared that India is the","Home of the Fairy Tale, and that all European fairy tales have been","brought from thence by Crusaders, by Mongol missionaries, by Gipsies,","by Jews, by traders, by travellers. The question is still before the","courts, and one can only deal with it as an advocate. So far as my","instructions go, I should be prepared, within certain limits, to hold","a brief for India. So far as the children of Europe have their fairy","stories in common, these--and they form more than a third of the","whole--are derived from India. In particular, the majority of the","Drolls or comic tales and jingles can be traced, without much","difficulty, back to the Indian peninsula.","","Certainly there is abundant evidence of the early transmission by","literary means of a considerable number of drolls and folk-tales from","India about the time of the Crusaders. The collections known in Europe","by the titles of _The Fables of Bidpai_, _The Seven Wise Masters_,","_Gesta Romanorum_, and _Barlaam and Josaphat_, were extremely popular","during the Middle Ages, and their contents passed on the one hand into","the _Exempla_ of the monkish preachers, and on the other into the","_Novelle_ of Italy, thence, after many days, to contribute their quota","to the Elizabethan Drama. Perhaps nearly one-tenth of the main","incidents of European folk-tales can be traced to this source.","","There are even indications of an earlier literary contact between","Europe and India, in the case of one branch of the folk-tale, the","Fable or Beast Droll. In a somewhat elaborate discussion[1] I have","come to the conclusion that a goodly number of the fables that pass","under the name of the Samian slave, Æsop, were derived from India,","probably from the same source whence the same tales were utilised in","the Jatakas, or Birth-stories of Buddha. These Jatakas contain a large","quantity of genuine early Indian folk-tales, and form the earliest","collection of folk-tales in the world, a sort of Indian Grimm,","collected more than two thousand years before the good German brothers","went on their quest among the folk with such delightful results. For","this reason I have included a considerable number of them in this","volume; and shall be surprised if tales that have roused the laughter","and wonder of pious Buddhists for the last two thousand years, cannot","produce the same effect on English children. The Jatakas have been","fortunate in their English translators, who render with vigour and","point; and I rejoice in being able to publish the translation of two","new Jatakas, kindly done into English for this volume by Mr. W. H. D.","Rouse, of Christ's College, Cambridge. In one of these I think I have","traced the source of the Tar Baby incident in \"Uncle Remus.\"","","[Footnote 1: \"History of the Æsopic Fable,\" the introductory volume to","my edition of Caxton's _Fables of Esope_ (London, Nutt, 1889).]","","Though Indian fairy tales are the earliest in existence, yet they are","also from another point of view the youngest. For it is only about","twenty-five years ago that Miss Frere began the modern collection of","Indian folk-tales with her charming \"Old Deccan Days\" (London, John","Murray, 1868; fourth edition, 1889). Her example has been followed by","Miss Stokes, by Mrs. Steel, and Captain (now Major) Temple, by the","Pandit Natesa Sastri, by Mr. Knowles and Mr. Campbell, as well as","others who have published folk-tales in such periodicals as the","_Indian Antiquary_ and _The Orientalist_. The story-store of modern","India has been well dipped into during the last quarter of a century,","though the immense range of the country leaves room for any number of","additional workers and collections. Even so far as the materials","already collected go, a large number of the commonest incidents in","European folk-tales have been found in India. Whether brought there or","born there, we have scarcely any criterion for judging; but as some of","those still current among the folk in India can be traced back more","than a millennium, the presumption is in favour of an Indian origin.","","From all these sources--from the Jatakas, from the Bidpai, and from","the more recent collections--I have selected those stories which throw","most light on the origin of Fable and Folk-tales, and at the same time","are most likely to attract English children. I have not, however,","included too many stories of the Grimm types, lest I should repeat","the contents of the two preceding volumes of this series. This has to","some degree weakened the case for India as represented by this book.","The need of catering for the young ones has restricted my selection","from the well-named \"Ocean of the Streams of Story,\" _Katha-Sarit","Sagara_ of Somadeva. The stories existing in Pali and Sanskrit I have","taken from translations, mostly from the German of Benfey or the","vigorous English of Professor Rhys-Davids, whom I have to thank for","permission to use his versions of the Jatakas.","","I have been enabled to make this book a representative collection of","the Fairy Tales of Ind by the kindness of the original collectors or","their publishers. I have especially to thank Miss Frere, who kindly","made an exception in my favour, and granted me the use of that fine","story, \"Punchkin,\" and that quaint myth, \"How Sun, Moon, and Wind went","out to Dinner.\" Miss Stokes has been equally gracious in granting me","the use of characteristic specimens from her \"Indian Fairy Tales.\" To","Major Temple I owe the advantage of selecting from his admirable","_Wideawake Stories_, and Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench \u0026 Co. have allowed","me to use Mr. Knowles' \"Folk-tales of Kashmir,\" in their Oriental","Library; and Messrs. W. H. Allen have been equally obliging with","regard to Mrs. Kingscote's \"Tales of the Sun.\" Mr. M. L. Dames has","enabled me add to the published story-store of India by granting me","the use of one from his inedited collection of Baluchi folk-tales.","","I have again to congratulate myself on the co-operation of my friend","Mr. J. D. Batten in giving beautiful or amusing form to the creations","of the folk fancy of the Hindoos. It is no slight thing to embody, as","he has done, the glamour and the humour both of the Celt and of the","Hindoo. It is only a further proof that Fairy Tales are something more","than Celtic or Hindoo. They are human.","","JOSEPH JACOBS.","","","","","Contents","","","                                                    PAGE","","I.      THE LION AND THE CRANE                        1","","II.

Now","it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.","The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was","terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking","for food, asked, \"What ails thee, friend?\" He told him why. \"I could","free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for","fear thou mightest eat me.\" \"Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat","thee; only save my life.\" \"Very well,\" says he, and caused him to lie","down on his left side. But thinking to himself, \"Who knows what this","fellow will do,\" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws","that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his","mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone","dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he","got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that","it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and","one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking \"I will","sound him,\" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation","spoke this first verse:","","    \"A service have we done thee","      To the best of our ability,","    King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!","      What return shall we get from thee?\"","","In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:","","    \"As I feed on blood,","      And always hunt for prey,","    'Tis much that thou art still alive","      Having once been between my teeth.\"","","Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:","","    \"Ungrateful, doing no good,","      Not doing as he would be done by,","    In him there is no gratitude,","      To serve him is useless.","","    \"His friendship is not won","      By the clearest good deed.","    Better softly withdraw from him,","      Neither envying nor abusing.\"","","And having thus spoken the crane flew away.","","_And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he","used to add: \"Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but","the white crane was I myself.\"_","","[Illustration: THE LION AND THE CRANE]","","","","","How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.","","","In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went","out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, \"You can hunt","wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the","fourth side.\" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth","side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he","would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess.","","The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time;","but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was","allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth","side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to","hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle,","and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it.","The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up","to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was","called Hiraman parrot.","","When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the","other parrots, \"Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son","shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam.\"","","Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince","was greatly surprised, and said, \"Why, these birds can talk!\" Then he","said to the parrots, \"Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?\"","But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. \"You can never get","to the Princess Labam's country.\" That is all they would say.","","The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more;","and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would","not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed","very ill.","","At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the","Princess Labam. \"I must go,\" he said; \"I must see what she is like.","Tell me where her country is.\"","","\"We do not know where it is,\" answered his father and mother.","","\"Then I must go and look for it,\" said the prince.","","\"No, no,\" they said, \"you must not leave us. You are our only son.","Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam.\"","","\"I must try and find her,\" said the prince. \"Perhaps God will show me","the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but","perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I","must go.\"","","So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with","him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And","he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other","weapons, \"for,\" he said, \"I may want them.\" His father, too, gave him","plenty of rupees.","","Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said","good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her","handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her","son. \"My child,\" she said to him, \"When you are hungry eat some of","these sweetmeats.\"","","He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a","jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his","horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. \"Now,\" he said to","himself, \"I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I","will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey.\" He opened","his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He","took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two","sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and","another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant.","\"Never mind,\" he said, \"I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat","them.\" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, \"You have","been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will","come to you.\"","","The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his","journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there","he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly","from the pain.","","\"Why do you roar like that?\" said the young Raja. \"What is the matter","with you?\"","","\"I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,\" answered the tiger,","\"and it hurts me so; that is why I roar.\"","","\"Well,\" said the Raja's son, \"I will take it out for you. But","perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat","me?\"","","[Illustration:]","","\"Oh, no,\" said the tiger, \"I won't eat you. Do make me well.\"","","Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn","out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than","ever--so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came","bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming,","and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him.","","[Illustration:]","","\"What man hurt you that you roared so loud?\" said the wife.","","\"No one hurt me,\" answered the husband; \"but a Raja's son came and","took the thorn out of my foot.\"","","\"Where is he? Show him to me,\" said his wife.","","\"If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,\" said the tiger.","","\"I won't kill him; only let me see him,\" answered his wife.","","Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and","his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good","dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at","the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said","good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, \"If ever you are in","trouble, think of me, and we will come to you.\"","","The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he","found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four","things,--a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he","wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels,","food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he","wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and","rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war","on him, \"Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,\" and the","stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up.","","The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, \"I","want this;\" another said, \"You cannot have it, for I want it;\" and so","on.","","The Raja's son said to them, \"Do not quarrel for these things. I will","shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets","to my first arrow, shall have the first thing--the bed. Whosoever gets","to the second arrow, shall have the second thing--the bag. He who gets","to the third arrow, shall have the third thing--the bowl. And he who","gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things--the stick and","rope.\" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow.","Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he","shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he","shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot","off the fourth.","","While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let","his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl,","the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, \"Bed, I wish","to go to the Princess Labam's country.\" The little bed instantly rose","up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to","the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The","Raja's son asked some men he saw, \"Whose country is this?\"","","\"The Princess Labam's country,\" they answered. Then the prince went on","till he came to a house where he saw an old woman.","","\"Who are you?\" she said. \"Where do you come from?\"","","\"I come from a far country,\" he said; \"do let me stay with you","to-night.\"","","\"No,\" she answered, \"I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has","ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You","cannot stay in my house.\"","","\"You are my aunty,\" said the prince; \"let me remain with you for this","one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then","the wild beasts will eat me.\"","","\"Well,\" said the old woman, \"you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow","morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the","night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison.\"","","Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad.","The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, \"Aunty,\" he","said, \"I will give you food.\" He put his hand into his bag, saying,","\"Bag, I want some dinner,\" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious","dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son","then dined together.","","When they had finished eating, the old woman said, \"Now I will fetch","some water.\"","","\"Don't go,\" said the prince. \"You shall have plenty of water","directly.\" So he took his bowl and said to it, \"Bowl, I want some","water,\" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince","cried out, \"Stop, bowl,\" and the bowl stopped filling. \"See, aunty,\"","he said, \"with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want.\"","","By this time night had come. \"Aunty,\" said the Raja's son, \"why don't","you light a lamp?\"","","\"There is no need,\" she said. \"Our king has forbidden the people in","his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his","daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she","shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we","can see to do our work as if it were day.\"","","When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself","in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her","head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the","moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat","on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her","house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's","country then went about their work and finished it.","","The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He","said to himself, \"How lovely she is!\"","","At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down","from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and","asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. \"Bed,\" he","said to it, \"I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room.\" So the","little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep.","","The young Raja took his bag and said, \"I want a great deal of","betel-leaf,\" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he","laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back","to the old woman's house.","","Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and","began to eat it. \"Where did you get all that betel-leaf?\" asked the","princess.","","\"We found it near your bed,\" answered the servants. Nobody knew the","prince had come in the night and put it all there.","","In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. \"Now it is","morning,\" she said, \"and you must go; for if the king finds out all I","have done for you, he will seize me.\"","","\"I am ill to-day, dear aunty,\" said the prince; \"do let me stay till","to-morrow morning.\"","","\"Good,\" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner","out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water.","","When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve","o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was","soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried","him to the princess. He took his bag and said, \"Bag, I want a most","lovely shawl.\" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the","princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house","and slept till morning.","","In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted.","\"See, mother,\" she said; \"Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is","so beautiful.\" Her mother was very glad too.","","\"Yes, my child,\" she said; \"Khuda must have given you this splendid","shawl.\"","","When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, \"Now you","must really go.\"","","\"Aunty,\" he answered, \"I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few","days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may","see me.\" So the old woman let him stay.","","When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and","jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went","to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room.","There he said to his bag, \"Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring.\"","The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's","hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much","frightened.","","\"Who are you?\" she said to the prince. \"Where do you come from? Why do","you come to my room?\"","","\"Do not be afraid, princess,\" he said; \"I am no thief. I am a great","Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to","hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and","came to see you.\"","","\"Well,\" said the princess, \"as you are the son of such a great Raja,","I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that","I wish to marry you.\"","","The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning","came the princess said to her mother, \"The son of a great Raja has","come to this country, and I wish to marry him.\" Her mother told this","to the king.","","\"Good,\" said the king; \"but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my","daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill","him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of","this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall","die.\"","","In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to","marry the princess. \"Oh,\" said the old woman, \"go away from this","country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and","Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them","all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do","whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if","he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things","the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have","tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do","go away.\" But the prince would not listen to anything she said.","","The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his","servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king.","There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to","crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him","to the court-house. \"Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,\" he said to","the prince, \"must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have","him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard","seed, you will die.\"","","The prince was very sorry when he heard this. \"How can I crush the oil","out of all this mustard seed in one day?\" he said to himself; \"and if","I do not, the king will kill me.\" He took the mustard seed to the old","woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the","Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to","him. \"Why do you look so sad?\" said the Ant-Raja.","","The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, \"How can I","crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not","take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me.\"","","\"Be happy,\" said the Ant-Raja; \"lie down and sleep; we will crush all","the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall","take it to the king.\" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants","crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the","oil.","","The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the","king said, \"You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so,","you must first fight with my two demons and kill them.\" The king a","long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what","to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let","them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country;","and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons","who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these","demons; \"for,\" said the king to himself, \"perhaps the demons may be","killed, and then I shall be rid of them.\"","","When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. \"What can I","do?\" he said to himself. \"How can I fight with these two demons?\" Then","he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and","said, \"Why are you so sad?\" The Raja's son answered, \"The king has","ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do","this?\" \"Do not be frightened,\" said the tiger. \"Be happy. I and my","wife will fight with them for you.\"","","[Illustration:]","","Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were","all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he","put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the","king, and said to him, \"May these tigers fight your demons for me?\"","\"Yes,\" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his","demons, provided they were killed. \"Then call your demons,\" said the","Raja's son, \"and these tigers will fight them.\" The king did so, and","the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had","killed the demons.","","\"That is good,\" said the king. \"But you must do something else before","I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must","go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you.\"","","The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old","woman's house and sat on his bed. \"Little bed,\" he said, \"up in the","sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it.\" The bed flew up","with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him.","Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter.","\"You have,\" he said to the prince, \"done the three things I told you","to do; but you must do one thing more.\" \"If I can, I will,\" said the","Raja's son.","","Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his","court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax","hatchet, and said, \"To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two","with this wax hatchet.\"","","The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad,","and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. \"I had his oil","crushed out by the ants,\" he said to himself. \"I had his demons killed","by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what","can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax","hatchet?\"","","At night he went on his bed to see the princess. \"To-morrow,\" he said","to her, \"your father will kill me.\" \"Why?\" asked the princess.","","\"He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet.","How can I ever do that?\" said the Raja's son. \"Do not be afraid,\" said","the princess; \"do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite","easily.\"","","Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince.","\"To-morrow,\" she said, \"when no one is near you, you must say to the","tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in","two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax","hatchet's blade.\"","","The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the","minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade","touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.","","The king said, \"Now you can marry my daughter.\" Then the wedding took","place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to","come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the","prince's son said to his wife, \"Let us go to my father's country.\" The","Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and","rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's","country, where they lived happily.","","The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one","ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick.","","","","","The Lambikin","","","Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on","his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly.","","Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy","to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who","should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and","said: \"Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!\"","","[Illustration:]","","But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:","","    \"To Granny's house I go,","    Where I shall fatter grow,","    Then you can eat me so.\"","","The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.","","By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the","tender morsel before him, said: \"Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!\"","","[Illustration:]","","But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:","","    \"To Granny's house I go,","    Where I shall fatter grow,","    Then you can eat me so.\"","","The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.","","And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an","Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:","\"Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!\"","","[Illustration:]","","But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:","","    \"To Granny's house I go,","    Where I shall fatter grow,","    Then you can eat me so.\"","","At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry,","\"Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to","keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin _at once_.\"","","So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin,","and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate,","and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said","he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little","Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to","eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender.","","\"I'll tell you what you must do,\" said Master Lambikin, \"you must make","a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and","then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a","drum myself.\"","","[Illustration:]","","So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin,","with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in","the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who","called out:","","    \"Drumikin! Drumikin!","    Have you seen Lambikin?\"","","And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:","","    \"Fallen into the fire, and so will you","    On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!\"","","\"How very annoying!\" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the","tender morsel he had let slip.","","Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:","","    \"Tum-pa, tum-too;","    Tum-pa, tum-too!\"","","Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:","","    \"Drumikin! Drumikin!","    Have you seen Lambikin?\"","","And to each of them the little slyboots replied:","","    \"Fallen into the fire, and so will you","    On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;","    Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!\"","","Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let","slip.","","At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as","sharp as a needle, and he too called out--","","    \"Drumikin! Drumikin!","    Have you seen Lambikin?\"","","And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:","","    \"Fallen into the fire, and so will you","    On little Drumikin! Tum-pa----\"","","But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at","once, and cried: \"Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?","Just you come out of that!\"","","Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.","","","","","Punchkin","","[Illustration:]","","","Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.","They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more","clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little","children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to","take care of them.","","The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner","every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the","affairs of the nation.","","About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter;","and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing","their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and","beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her","sisters, \"Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at","her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come","here, we shall suffer for it some day.\"","","But the other sisters would answer, \"Be quiet, Balna; why must you","always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if","she likes.\" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take","a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly","throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared","for the Raja's dinner.","","Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's","death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to","avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he","found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from","their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have","put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to","reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated","many successive days.","","At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters","cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,","and watched them through a hole in the wall.","","There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and","preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by","the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come","to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her","dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, \"Why don't you","keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take","ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for","herself.\"","","Then the eldest sister answered, \"Balna, let the poor woman take the","wood and the fire; she does us no harm.\" But Balna replied, \"If you","let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make","us sorry for it, some day.\"","","The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his","dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a","little mud into each of the dishes.","","At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and","brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had","played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and","she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,","that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his","Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.","","Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get","them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might","have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their","place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to","her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them","nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little","water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been","accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food","and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and","unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead","mother's tomb and cry--and say:","","\"Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we","are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?\"","","One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a","beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh","ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some","of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the","bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to","their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the","beautiful tree.","","Then the Ranee said to her daughter, \"I cannot tell how it is, every","day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat","any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than","you do. I cannot tell how it is.\" And she bade her watch the seven","Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat.","","So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and","were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed","them, and saw them gathering the fruit.","","Then Balna said to her sisters, \"Do you not see that girl watching us?","Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell","her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us.\"","","But the other sisters said, \"Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl","would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite","her to come and have some of the fruit.\" And calling her to them,","they gave her one of the pomeloes.","","No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went","home and said to her mother, \"I do not wonder the seven Princesses","will not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's","grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day","and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever","tasted.\"","","The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she","stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad","headache. The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, \"What can","I do for you?\" She answered, \"There is only one thing that will make","my headache well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo","tree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put","a little of the water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and","that will cure my headache.\" So the Raja sent his servants, and had","the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee","desired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was","put on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite","well.","","Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of","their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to","cry very bitterly.","","Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were","crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like","substance, which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing","this all the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake,","and liked it; and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on","for many days. Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's","grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like","cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter: \"I cannot tell","how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the","Ranee's grave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor","look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot","tell how it is!\"","","And her daughter said, \"I will watch.\"","","Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should","come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and","said, \"See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the","edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some","of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very","unfortunate for us.\"","","The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious,","and instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter","some of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.","","The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly","angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and","fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she","next day pretended to be very, very ill--in fact, at the point of","death--and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it","was in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: \"Only one","thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it.\" He replied,","\"Yes, whatever it is, I will do it.\" She then said, \"To save my life,","you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of","their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their","death will be my life.\" At these words the Raja was very sorrowful;","but because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy","heart to find his daughters.","","He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.","","Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,","and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made","a fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the","afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep,","and when he saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole","away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: \"It is","better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by their","step-mother.\"","","He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the","forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had","really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.","","Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves","all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to","call out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear;","but he was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear","them even had their voices been as loud as thunder.","","It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a","neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as","they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest","Prince said to his brothers: \"Stop, I think I hear some one crying and","calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of","the sound, and find out what it is.\"","","So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the","place where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.","At the sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and","still more so on learning their story; and they settled that each","should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry","her.","","So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,","and married her.","","And the second took the second;","","And the third took the third;","","And the fourth took the fourth;","","And the fifth took the fifth;","","And the sixth took the sixth;","","And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna.","","And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing","throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to","seven such beautiful Princesses.","","About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and","aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers","and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any","children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged","their heir by all the rest.","","They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the","seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and","away he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.","","Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of","him; and they went away, but they also did not return.","","And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their","kind husbands must have been killed.","","One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her","baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below,","there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said","that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, \"You","cannot go into the palace--the Raja's sons have all gone away; we","think they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by","your begging.\" But he said, \"I am a holy man, you must let me in.\"","Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did","not know that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.","","Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful","things there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing","beside her little boy's cradle. The Magician thought her more","beautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch","that he asked her to go home with him and to marry him. But she said,","\"My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young;","I will stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is","grown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings of","his father. Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry you.\"","At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into a","little black dog, and led her away; saying, \"Since you will not come","with me of your own free will, I will make you.\" So the poor Princess","was dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or of","letting her sisters know what had become of her. As Punchkin passed","through the palace gate the servants said to him, \"Where did you get","that pretty little dog?\" And he answered, \"One of the Princesses gave","it to me as a present.\" At hearing which they let him go without","further questioning.","","Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their","nephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much","surprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then","they questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and the","little black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in every","direction seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be","found. What could six poor women do? They gave up all hopes of ever","seeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband, again,","and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of","their little nephew.","","Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old. Then, one","day, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did","he hear it, than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of","his father and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to","bring them home again. His aunts, on learning his determination, were","much alarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, \"We have lost our","husbands, and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole","hope; if you go away, what shall we do?\" But he replied, \"I pray you","not to be discouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring","my father and mother and uncles with me.\" So he set out on his","travels; but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in","his search.","","At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and","become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his","parents, he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and","rocks, and trees, and there he saw a large palace with a high tower;","hard by which was a Malee's little house.","","As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of the","house and said, \"My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this","dangerous place?\" He answered, \"I am a Raja's son, and I come in","search of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked","enchanter bewitched.\"","","Then the Malee's wife said, \"This country and this palace belong to a","great enchanter; he is all powerful, and if any one displeases him, he","can turn them into stones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see","here were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what","they now are. Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly","afterwards came his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones","and trees; and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that","tower lives a beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner","there for twelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him.\"","","Then the little Prince thought, \"These must be my parents and my","uncles. I have found what I seek at last.\" So he told his story to the","Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that place","awhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she","mentioned; and she promised to befriend him, and advised his","disguising himself lest the Magician should see him, and turn him","likewise into stone. To this the Prince agreed. So the Malee's wife","dressed him up in a saree, and pretended that he was her daughter.","","One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his","garden he saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked","her who she was. She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the","Magician said, \"You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall","take a present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in","the tower.\"","","The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went","immediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom","he determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his","disguise, and trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for","establishing some communication with his mother, if it were indeed","she.","","Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her a","small gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on","her little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was","older his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able","to wear it. The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-known","treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trust","to her recognising it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as","such a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of her","ever establishing communication with her friends), that though the","supposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,","the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.","At last one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one","was looking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at","Balna's feet. It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to","see what made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the","flowers. On recognising it, she at once believed the story her son","told her of his long search, and begged him to advise her as to what","she had better do; at the same time entreating him on no account to","endanger his life by trying to rescue her. She told him that for","twelve long years the Magician had kept her shut up in the tower","because she refused to marry him, and she was so closely guarded that","she saw no hope of release.","","Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, \"Do not fear,","dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the","Magician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate my","father and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and","trees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; now","rather speak kindly. Tell him you have given up all hopes of again","seeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing","to marry him. Then endeavour to find out what his power consists in,","and whether he is immortal, or can be put to death.\"","","Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent for","Punchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.","","The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to","take place as soon as possible.","","But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a","little more time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that,","after being enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen by","degrees. \"And do tell me,\" she said, \"are you quite immortal? Can","death never touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel","human suffering?\"","","\"Why do you ask?\" said he.","","\"Because,\" she replied, \"if I am to be your wife, I would fain know","all about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome,","or if possible to avert it.\"","","\"It is true,\" he added, \"that I am not as others. Far, far away,","hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate","country covered with thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a","circle of palm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six","chattees full of water, piled one above another: below the sixth","chattee is a small cage which contains a little green parrot; on the","life of the parrot depends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must","die. It is, however,\" he added, \"impossible that the parrot should","sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the","country, and because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround","the palm trees, and kill all who approach the place.\"","","Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time","implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.","","The Prince, however, replied, \"Mother, unless I can get hold of that","parrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be not","afraid, I will shortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in","good humour--still putting off your marriage with him on various","pretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here.\"","So saying, he went away.","","Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thick","jungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep.","He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a","large serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in the","tree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles. The","Prince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and","killed the serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in","the air, and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for","their young ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and the","young Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him,","\"Dear boy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by","that cruel serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children;","whenever you are in need, therefore, send to us and we will help you;","and as for these little eagles, take them, and let them be your","servants.\"","","At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their","wings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over","the thick jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle of","palm trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of","water. It was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great. All","round the trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were","such countless thousands of them, that it would have been quite","impossible for any one to walk through their ranks to the place; down","swooped the strong-winged eaglets--down jumped the Prince; in an","instant he had overthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized","the little green parrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as","he mounted again into the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding","their treasure gone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.","","Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the","great tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, \"Take back your","little ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand in","need of help, I will not fail to come to you.\" He then continued his","journey on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace,","where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot.","Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, \"My boy, where","did you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you.\"","","But the Prince answered, \"Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a","great pet of mine; I have had it many years.\"","","Then the Magician said, \"If it is an old favourite, I can understand","your not caring to give it away; but come what will you sell it for?\"","","\"Sir,\" replied the Prince, \"I will not sell my parrot.\"","","Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, \"Anything, anything; name what","price you will, and it shall be yours.\" The Prince answered, \"Let the","seven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly","liberated.\"","","\"It is done as you desire,\" said the Magician, \"only give me my","parrot.\" And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband and","his brothers resumed their natural shapes. \"Now, give me my parrot,\"","repeated Punchkin.","","\"Not so fast, my master,\" rejoined the Prince; \"I must first","beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned.\"","","[Illustration: Punchkin's Prisoners are set free.]","","The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried,","in an imploring voice, \"Give me my parrot!\" the whole garden became","suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,","stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing","horses, and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants.","","\"Give me my parrot!\" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the","parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's","right arm fell off.","","Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, \"Give me my parrot!\"","The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's","left arm tumbled off.","","\"Give me my parrot!\" cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince","pulled off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off:","the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's","left.","","Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still","he rolled his eyes, and cried, \"Give me my parrot!\" \"Take your parrot,","then,\" cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and","threw it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted","round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!","","Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven","Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever","afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own","house.","","","","","The Broken Pot","","","There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was","Svabhavak_ri_pa_n_a, which means \"a born miser.\" He had collected a","quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled","a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall,","placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he","thought, \"Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should","be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this","I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six","months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the","goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the","calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the","buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of","horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall","get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house,","and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will","have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman.","","[Illustration:]","","When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit","with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy","will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be","danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full","of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she,","distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and","give her such a kick with my foot.\" While he thought this, he gave a","kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and","made him quite white. Therefore, I say, \"He who makes foolish plans","for the future will be white all over, like the father of","Somasarman.\"","","","","","The Magic Fiddle","","","Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers","were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family.","It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives","for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length","they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general","provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, \"She","does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home,","and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time.\" They then","called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his","good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, \"At midday when","our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that","on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly","re-appear. In this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow","into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own.\"","","At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her,","and she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to","rise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it","would not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and","cry to her brother:","","[Illustration:]","","    \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,","    Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"","","The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began","to wail again:","","    \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,","    Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"","","The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried","again:","","    \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,","    Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"","","The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:","","    \"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,","    Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.\"","","At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning,","then she cried aloud:","","    \"Oh! my brother, the water measures a man's height,","    Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill.\"","","The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was","drowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and","carried her off.","","After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of","the tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to","an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way,","seeing it, said to himself, \"This will make a splendid fiddle.\" So one","day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin,","the bamboo called out, \"Do not cut at the root, cut higher up.\" When","he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, \"Do","not cut near the top, cut at the root.\" When the Jogi again prepared","himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, \"Do not cut","at the root, cut higher up;\" and when he was about to cut higher up,","it again called out to him, \"Do not cut high up, cut at the root.\" The","Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him,","so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it","away made a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and","delighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went","a-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned","home every evening with a full wallet.","","He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga","girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly.","Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail","as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and","offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to","part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value,","and refused to sell it.","","It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a","village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for","something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high","price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him","his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed","upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the","latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While","he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted","their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his","instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to","return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart,","leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used","to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth","delighted the ears of all who heard it.","","When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the","Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the","family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the","chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust,","re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of","the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this","manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble","themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however,","was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so","attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, \"I will catch her","to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed","before the others.\" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of","firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and","began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the","meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the","young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter","the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught","her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, \"Fie! Fie! you may be a","Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot","marry.\" He said, \"No. But from to-day, you and I are one.\" So they","began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others","returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being","and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly.","","Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and","her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit.","","The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she","was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set","cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in","wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been","subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her,","and wound up by saying, \"You must have known it all, and yet you did","not interfere to save me.\" And that was all the revenge she took.","","[Illustration:]","","","","","The Cruel Crane Outwitted","","[Illustration:]","","","Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree","standing near a certain lotus pond.","","Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a","certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish.","And a crane thought on seeing the fish:","","\"I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them.\"","","And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he","should do it.","","When the fish saw him, they asked him, \"What are you sitting there","for, lost in thought?\"","","\"I am sitting thinking about you,\" said he.","","\"Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?\" said they.","","\"Why,\" he replied; \"there is very little water in this pond, and but","little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking,","'What in the world will these fish do now?'\"","","\"Yes, indeed, sir! what _are_ we to do?\" said they.","","\"If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a","fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you","into it,\" answered the crane.","","\"That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard","of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other,","that you're aiming at.\"","","\"Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't","believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go","and see it.\"","","Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number--a","big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any","emergency, afloat or ashore.","","Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the","whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other","fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond.","","And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, \"All right, sir! You","may take us with you.\"","","Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the","other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there.","But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and","killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the","foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:","","\"I've thrown that fish in; let another one come.\"","","And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them,","till he came back and found no more!","","But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he","would eat him too, and called out:","","\"I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a","fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!\"","","\"But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?\"","","\"I'll bite hold of you with my beak.\"","","\"You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!\"","","\"Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way.\"","","Then said the crab to himself, \"If this fellow once got hold of fish,","he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me","into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't--then I'll cut","his throat, and kill him!\" So he said to him:","","\"Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we","crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the","neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you.\"","","And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and","agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely","as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, \"Off with you,","now!\"","","And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off","towards the Varana-tree.","","\"Uncle!\" cried the crab, \"the pond lies that way, but you are taking","me this way!\"","","\"Oh, that's it, is it?\" answered the crane. \"Your dear little uncle,","your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I","suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you","about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at","the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every","one of them, just so I will devour you as well!\"","","\"Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,\" answered the","crab; \"but I'm not going to let you eat _me_. On the contrary, is it","_you_ that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen","that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will","cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!\" And so saying,","he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice.","","Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling","with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, \"O my Lord!","Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!\"","","\"Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there.\"","","And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the","crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as","clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then","only entered the water!","","When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair,","he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant","voice the verse:","","    \"The villain, though exceeding clever,","    Shall prosper not by his villainy.","    He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,","    But only as the Crane here from the Crab!\"","","[Illustration:]","","","","","Loving Laili","","","Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees","and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun,","who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red","cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing","with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which","was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees.","They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat","them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and","write.","","One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said","to his father, \"Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt.\" His","father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else","they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country,","hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds.","","The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a","daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and","black hair.","","One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's","kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man","who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and","that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her","father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid","no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating,","\"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,\" and would say nothing else. Even as","she sat and ate her food she kept saying, \"Majnun, Majnun; I want","Majnun.\" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. \"Who is this","Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?\" he would say.","","\"He is the man I am to marry,\" said Laili. \"Khuda has ordered me to","marry no one but Majnun.\" And she was half mad.","","Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana","country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to","eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying,","\"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.\" The prince heard her, and turned","round. \"Who is calling me?\" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and","the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said","to herself, \"I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am","to marry.\" And she went home to her father and said, \"Father, I wish","to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the","Prince Majnun I am to marry.\"","","\"Very well, you shall have him for your husband,\" said Munsuk Raja.","\"We will ask him to-morrow.\" Laili consented to wait, although she was","very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom","that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She","would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants","said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to","jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country.","All the time she kept saying, \"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;\" and so","she wandered about for twelve years.","","At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir--he was really an","angel, but she did not know this--who asked her, \"Why do you always","say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?\" She answered, \"I am the","daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince","Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is.\"","","\"I think you will never get there,\" said the fakir, \"for it is very","far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it.\" But","Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. \"Well,\" said","the fakir, \"when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big","fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's","country, or you will never reach it.\"","","She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river.","There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just","as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its","stomach. All the time she kept saying, \"Majnun, Majnun.\" At this the","Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he","could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and","perched on his back, and said \"Caw, caw.\" \"Oh, Mr. Crow,\" said the","poor fish \"do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise.\"","","\"Very well,\" said the crow, \"open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down","and see.\" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he","came up again very quickly. \"You have a Rakshas in your stomach,\" said","the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu,","and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There","he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. \"Oh,","jackal,\" said the Rohu, \"do tell me what I have inside me.\"","","[Illustration:]","","\"How can I tell?\" said the jackal. \"I cannot see unless I go inside","you.\" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down","his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and","saying, \"You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away","quickly, I am afraid it will eat me.\" So off he ran. After the jackal","came an enormous snake. \"Oh,\" says the fish, \"do tell me what I have","in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun,","Majnun; I want Majnun.'\"","","The snake said, \"Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what","it is.\" The snake went down: when he returned he said, \"You have a","Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will","come out of you.\" \"If you do that, I shall die,\" said the Rohu. \"Oh,","no,\" said the snake, \"you will not, for I will give you a medicine","that will make you quite well again.\" So the fish agreed, and the","snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili.","","She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle,","and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no","longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his","back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and","she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where","King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, \"Majnun,","Majnun; I want Majnun,\" and they asked her what she wanted. \"I want","King Majnun,\" she said.","","So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, \"An old woman outside says","she wants you.\" \"I cannot leave this place,\" said he; \"send her in","here.\" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted.","\"I want to marry you,\" she answered. \"Twenty-four years ago you came","to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you","then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I","have wandered about all these years looking for you.\" Prince Majnun","said, \"Very good.\"","","\"Pray to Khuda,\" said Laili, \"to make us both young again, and then we","shall be married.\" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to","him, \"Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they","are on fire, she and you will become young again.\" When he touched","Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again.","And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to","the Phalana country to see her father and mother.","","Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that","they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating,","\"Laili, Laili, Laili.\" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to","Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the","father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then","they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince","Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years,","and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time","with him.","","They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to","country to eat the air and amuse themselves.","","One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, \"Let us go through this jungle.\"","\"No, no,\" said Laili; \"if we go through this jungle, some harm will","happen to me.\" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle.","And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, \"I should like to","know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if","she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see.\" So he sent one","of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel","went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she","fell to the ground a heap of ashes.","","Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili","turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his","father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a","great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go","again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King","Dantal wished his son to marry again. \"I will only have Laili for my","wife; I will not marry any other woman,\" said Prince Majnun.","","\"How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to","you,\" said the father.","","\"Then I'll not have any wife at all,\" said Prince Majnun.","","Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left","her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had","taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay","and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them,","and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But","Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long","nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her","teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she","lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on","saying, \"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.\"","","At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at","her, said to Khuda, \"Of what use is it that this woman should sit in","the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'","and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun.\"","\"Well,\" said Khuda, \"you may do so; but tell her that she must not","speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if","he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the","next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her","human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food,","and lets her sleep in his bed.\"","","So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King","Dantal's garden. \"Now,\" he said, \"it is Khuda's command that you stay","here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may","show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid","of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a","little white dog.\" He then told her what she must do as a little dog","to regain her human form.","","Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince","Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was","now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as","old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who","had been made quite young again when he married Laili.","","As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they","gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit","the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy","eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he","turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. \"Oh,","look, look!\" he cried, \"see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or","a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us.\" Laili looked at him","beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness;","but this only frightened Majnun the more. \"It is a Rakshas, a","Rakshas!\" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's","son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran","to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in","the garden that had come to eat them.","","\"What nonsense,\" said his father. \"Fancy two grown men being so","frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it","would not have eaten you.\" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun","had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was","speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the","terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he","was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would","not walk in the garden any more.","","The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape","she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of","her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out","hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her","with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the","little dog slept in his bed.","","But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay","the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and","now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or","some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried","out, \"What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!\" Poor Laili","answered, \"Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to","marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle,","though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm","would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face,","and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and","brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle","crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you","will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more.\" Majnun, however,","said \"How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I","am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,\" and he was in","great terror.","","In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the","prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. \"An old","woman! an old woman! always an old woman!\" said his father. \"You do","nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so","easily frightened?\" However, when he saw that his son was really in","great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came","back at night, he advised him to say to her, \"I will marry you if you","can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old","woman as you are?\"","","That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there","in place of the dog, crying \"Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I","have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's","kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me,","and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so","suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you.\" \"Well,\" said","Majnun, \"if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry","you.\"","","Laili said, \"Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl","again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you","will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your","room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it","when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite","alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at","all on.\" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and","disappeared in the garden.","","Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the","old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son","walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit.","\"Oh!\" said the Prince, \"I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit.\"","Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till","he had told his father, who said, \"That must be the fruit; go and","gather it.\" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and","he said to his father, \"Come with me to my room while I open it; I am","afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that","will eat me.\"","","\"No,\" said King Dantal; \"remember, Laili will be naked; you must go","alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit,","for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a","loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to","eat you.\"","","Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for","he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young","and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her","extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor.","","Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari","(for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal,","and said to him sadly, \"Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will","he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen","me so many, many times.\"","","King Dantal answered, \"It is because you are so beautiful. You are","far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy","directly.\" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face","and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again.","","Then Laili said, \"Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?\"","","\"Oh!\" said Prince Majnun, \"I see you are Laili come back to me, but","your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I","saw them.\" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the","drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played","on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the","servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs.","","After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife","went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a","groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden.","\"We must go into that garden and see it,\" said Majnun.","","\"No, no,\" said Laili; \"it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very","wicked man.\" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all","Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as","he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards","them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and","seize her. So she said to Majnun, \"Come, come, let us go; do not go","near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he","will kill you to seize me.\"","","\"What nonsense,\" said Majnun. \"I believe he is a very good Raja.","Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away.\"","","\"Well,\" said Laili, \"it is better that you should be killed than I,","for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my","life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed.\" Now","Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought","Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his","scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow.","","Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her","she said, \"Why did you kill my husband?\"","","\"Because I want to take you,\" he answered.","","\"You cannot,\" said Laili.","","\"Yes, I can,\" said the Raja.","","\"Take me, then,\" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close","and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she","put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long","as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant","till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her","arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one","touch.","","Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead","body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from","the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like","healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and","smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and","said, \"What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had","slept for years!\" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by","Laili's horse.","","\"What's that?\" said Majnun.","","\"That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he","would.\"","","\"Who killed him?\" asked Majnun.","","\"I did,\" answered Laili, \"and it was I who brought you to life.\"","","\"Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,\" said Majnun.","","\"No,\" said Laili, \"for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you","harm.\" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to","bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, \"Jump up on the","horse, then, and go far away with the groom.\"","","\"What will you do,\" said Majnun, \"if I leave you? I cannot leave you.\"","","\"I will take care of myself,\" said Laili; \"but this man is so wicked,","he may kill you again if you are near him.\" So Majnun got up on the","horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili.","Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and","she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine","came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife","had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began","to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who","tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband,","and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's","palace.","","[Illustration: How Loving Laili became young again]","","There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified","and angry. \"How lucky for you that you have such a wife,\" he said.","\"Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now","dead.\" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's","safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much","of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he","built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of","ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and","heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but","their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not","allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; \"for,\" said King Dantal,","\"Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take","her away.\"","","","","","The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal","","[Illustration:]","","","Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to","get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when","he failed.","","By chance a poor Brahman came by. \"Let me out of this cage, oh pious","one!\" cried the tiger.","","\"Nay, my friend,\" replied the Brahman mildly, \"you would probably eat","me if I did.\"","","\"Not at all!\" swore the tiger with many oaths; \"on the contrary, I","should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!\"","","Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious","Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of","the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried,","\"What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after","being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!\"","","In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a","promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to","question as to the justice of the tiger's action.","","So the Brahman first asked a _pipal_ tree what it thought of the","matter, but the _pipal_ tree replied coldly, \"What have you to","complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes","by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their","cattle? Don't whimper--be a man!\"","","Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a","buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it","answered, \"You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I","gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry","they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!\"","","The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion.","","\"My dear sir,\" said the road, \"how foolish you are to expect anything","else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great","and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the","ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!\"","","On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a","jackal, who called out, \"Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look","as miserable as a fish out of water!\"","","The Brahman told him all that had occurred. \"How very confusing!\" said","the jackal, when the recital was ended; \"would you mind telling me","over again, for everything has got so mixed up?\"","","The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a","distracted sort of way, and still could not understand.","","\"It's very odd,\" said he, sadly, \"but it all seems to go in at one ear","and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened,","and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.\"","","So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the","Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws.","","\"You've been away a long time!\" growled the savage beast, \"but now let","us begin our dinner.\"","","\"_Our_ dinner!\" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked","together with fright; \"what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!\"","","\"Give me five minutes, my lord!\" he pleaded, \"in order that I may","explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.\"","","The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again,","not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.","","\"Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!\" cried the jackal, wringing its","paws. \"Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the","tiger came walking by----\"","","\"Pooh!\" interrupted the tiger, \"what a fool you are! _I_ was in the","cage.\"","","\"Of course!\" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright;","\"yes! I was in the cage--no I wasn't--dear! dear! where are my wits?","Let me see--the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking","by----no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your","dinner, for I shall never understand!\"","","\"Yes, you shall!\" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's","stupidity; \"I'll _make_ you understand! Look here--I am the tiger----\"","","\"Yes, my lord!\"","","\"And that is the Brahman----\"","","\"Yes, my lord!\"","","\"And that is the cage----\"","","\"Yes, my lord!\"","","\"And I was in the cage--do you understand?\"","","\"Yes--no---- Please, my lord----\"","","\"Well?\" cried the tiger impatiently.","","\"Please, my lord!--how did you get in?\"","","\"How!--why in the usual way, of course!\"","","\"Oh, dear me!--my head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't be","angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?\"","","At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried,","\"This way! Now do you understand how it was?\"","","\"Perfectly!\" grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, \"and","if you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they","were!\"","","","","","The Soothsayer's Son","","","A soothsayer when on his deathbed wrote out the horoscope of his","second son, whose name was Gangazara, and bequeathed it to him as his","only property, leaving the whole of his estate to his eldest son. The","second son thought over the horoscope, and said to himself:","","\"Alas! am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my father","never failed. I have seen them prove true to the last word while he","was living; and how has he fixed my horoscope! 'FROM MY BIRTH","POVERTY!' Nor is that my only fate. 'FOR TEN YEARS, IMPRISONMENT'--a","fate harder than poverty; and what comes next? 'DEATH ON THE","SEA-SHORE'; which means that I must die away from home, far from","friends and relatives on a sea-coast. Now comes the most curious part","of the horoscope, that I am to 'HAVE SOME HAPPINESS AFTERWARDS!' What","this happiness is, is an enigma to me.\"","","Thus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father","were over, took leave of his elder brother, and started for Benares.","He went by the middle of the Deccan, avoiding both the coasts, and","went on journeying and journeying for weeks and months, till at last","he reached the Vindhya mountains. While passing that desert he had to","journey for a couple of days through a sandy plain, with no signs of","life or vegetation. The little store of provision with which he was","provided for a couple of days, at last was exhausted. The chombu,","which he carried always full, filling it with the sweet water from the","flowing rivulet or plenteous tank, he had exhausted in the heat of the","desert. There was not a morsel in his hand to eat; nor a drop of water","to drink. Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert, out","of which he saw no means of escape. Still he thought within himself,","\"Surely my father's prophecy never proved untrue. I must survive this","calamity to find my death on some sea-coast.\" So thought he, and this","thought gave him strength of mind to walk fast and try to find a drop","of water somewhere to slake his dry throat.","","At last he succeeded; heaven threw in his way a ruined well. He","thought he could collect some water if he let down his chombu with the","string that he always carried noosed to the neck of it. Accordingly he","let it down; it went some way and stopped, and the following words","came from the well: \"Oh, relieve me! I am the king of tigers, dying","here of hunger. For the last three days I have had nothing. Fortune","has sent you here. If you assist me now you will find a sure help in","me throughout your life. Do not think that I am a beast of prey. When","you have become my deliverer I will never touch you. Pray, kindly lift","me up.\" Gangazara thought: \"Shall I take him out or not? If I take him","out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. No; that he","will not do. For my father's prophecy never came untrue. I must die on","a sea coast, and not by a tiger.\" Thus thinking, he asked the","tiger-king to hold tight to the vessel, which he accordingly did, and","he lifted him up slowly. The tiger reached the top of the well and","felt himself on safe ground. True to his word, he did no harm to","Gangazara. On the other hand, he walked round his patron three times,","and standing before him, humbly spoke the following words: \"My","life-giver, my benefactor! I shall never forget this day, when I","regained my life through your kind hands. In return for this kind","assistance I pledge my oath to stand by you in all calamities.","Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I am there with","you ready to oblige you by all the means that I can. To tell you","briefly how I came in here: Three days ago I was roaming in yonder","forest, when I saw a goldsmith passing through it. I chased him. He,","finding it impossible to escape my claws, jumped into this well, and","is living to this moment in the very bottom of it. I also jumped in,","but found myself on the first ledge of the well; he is on the last and","fourth ledge. In the second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger.","On the third lies a rat, also half-famished, and when you again begin","to draw water these may request you first to release them. In the same","way the goldsmith also may ask you. I beg you, as your bosom friend,","never assist that wretched man, though he is your relation as a human","being. Goldsmiths are never to be trusted. You can place more faith in","me, a tiger, though I feast sometimes upon men, in a serpent, whose","sting makes your blood cold the very next moment, or in a rat, which","does a thousand pieces of mischief in your house. But never trust a","goldsmith. Do not release him; and if you do, you shall surely repent","of it one day or other.\" Thus advising, the hungry tiger went away","without waiting for an answer.","","[Illustration:]","","Gangazara thought several times of the eloquent way in which the tiger","spoke, and admired his fluency of speech. But still his thirst was not","quenched. So he let down his vessel again, which was now caught hold","of by the serpent, who addressed him thus: \"Oh, my protector! Lift me","up. I am the king of serpents, and the son of Adisesha, who is now","pining away in agony for my disappearance. Release me now. I shall","ever remain your servant, remember your assistance, and help you","throughout life in all possible ways. Oblige me: I am dying.\"","Gangazara, calling again to mind the \"DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE\" of the","prophecy lifted him up. He, like the tiger-king, walked round him","thrice, and prostrating himself before him spoke thus: \"Oh, my","life-giver, my father, for so I must call you, as you have given me","another birth. I was three days ago basking myself in the morning sun,","when I saw a rat running before me. I chased him. He fell into this","well. I followed him, but instead of falling on the third storey where","he is now lying, I fell into the second. I am going away now to see my","father. Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I will be","there by your side to assist you by all possible means.\" So saying,","the Nagaraja glided away in zigzag movements, and was out of sight in","a moment.","","The poor son of the Soothsayer, who was now almost dying of thirst,","let down his vessel for a third time. The rat caught hold of it, and","without discussing he lifted up the poor animal at once. But it would","not go away without showing its gratitude: \"Oh, life of my life! My","benefactor! I am the king of rats. Whenever you are in any calamity","just think of me. I will come to you, and assist you. My keen ears","overheard all that the tiger-king told you about the goldsmith, who is","in the fourth storey. It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths","ought never to be trusted. Therefore, never assist him as you have","done to us all. And if you do, you will suffer for it. I am hungry;","let me go for the present.\" Thus taking leave of his benefactor, the","rat, too, ran away.","","Gangazara for a while thought upon the repeated advice given by the","three animals about releasing the goldsmith: \"What wrong would there","be in my assisting him? Why should I not release him also?\" So","thinking to himself, Gangazara let down the vessel again. The","goldsmith caught hold of it, and demanded help. The Soothsayer's son","had no time to lose; he was himself dying of thirst. Therefore he","lifted the goldsmith up, who now began his story. \"Stop for a while,\"","said Gangazara, and after quenching his thirst by letting down his","vessel for the fifth time, still fearing that some one might remain in","the well and demand his assistance, he listened to the goldsmith, who","began as follows: \"My dear friend, my protector, what a deal of","nonsense these brutes have been talking to you about me; I am glad you","have not followed their advice. I am just now dying of hunger. Permit","me to go away. My name is Manikkasari. I live in the East main street","of Ujjaini, which is twenty kas to the south of this place, and so","lies on your way when you return from Benares. Do not forget to come","to me and receive my kind remembrances of your assistance, on your way","back to your country.\" So saying, the goldsmith took his leave, and","Gangazara also pursued his way north after the above adventures.","","He reached Benares, and lived there for more than ten years, and quite","forgot the tiger, serpent, rat, and goldsmith. After ten years of","religious life, thoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his","mind. \"I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances.","Let me return home.\" Thus thought Gangazara within himself, and very","soon he was on his way back to his country. Remembering the prophecy","of his father he returned by the same way by which he went to Benares","ten years before. While thus retracing his steps he reached the ruined","well where he had released the three brute kings and the goldsmith. At","once the old recollections rushed into his mind, and he thought of the","tiger to test his fidelity. Only a moment passed, and the tiger-king","came running before him carrying a large crown in his mouth, the","glitter of the diamonds of which for a time outshone even the bright","rays of the sun. He dropped the crown at his life-giver's feet, and,","putting aside all his pride, humbled himself like a pet cat to the","strokes of his protector, and began in the following words: \"My","life-giver! How is it that you have forgotten me, your poor servant,","for such a long time? I am glad to find that I still occupy a corner","in your mind. I can never forget the day when I owed my life to your","lotus hands. I have several jewels with me of little value. This","crown, being the best of all, I have brought here as a single ornament","of great value, which you can carry with you and dispose of in your","own country.\" Gangazara looked at the crown, examined it over and","over, counted and recounted the gems, and thought within himself that","he would become the richest of men by separating the diamonds and","gold, and selling them in his own country. He took leave of the","tiger-king, and after his disappearance thought of the kings of","serpents and rats, who came in their turn with their presents, and","after the usual greetings and exchange of words took their leave.","Gangazara was extremely delighted at the faithfulness with which the","brute beasts behaved, and went on his way to the south. While going","along he spoke to himself thus: \"These beasts have been very faithful","in their assistance. Much more, therefore, must Manikkasari be","faithful. I do not want anything from him now. If I take this crown","with me as it is, it occupies much space in my bundle. It may also","excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way. I will go now to","Ujjaini on my way. Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure","on my return journey. I shall do so, and request him to have the crown","melted, the diamonds and gold separated. He must do that kindness at","least for me. I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my","rags, and wend my way homewards.\" Thus thinking and thinking, he","reached Ujjaini. At once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith","friend, and found him without difficulty. Manikkasari was extremely","delighted to find on his threshold him who ten years before,","notwithstanding the advice repeatedly given him by the sage-looking","tiger, serpent, and rat, had relieved him from the pit of death.","Gangazara at once showed him the crown that he received from the","tiger-king, told him how he got it, and requested his kind assistance","to separate the gold and diamonds. Manikkasari agreed to do so, and","meanwhile asked his friend to rest himself for a while to have his","bath and meals; and Gangazara, who was very observant of his religious","ceremonies, went direct to the river to bathe.","","How came the crown in the jaws of the tiger? The king of Ujjaini had a","week before gone with all his hunters on a hunting expedition. All of","a sudden the tiger-king started from the wood, seized the king, and","vanished.","","When the king's attendants informed the prince about the death of his","father he wept and wailed, and gave notice that he would give half of","his kingdom to any one who should bring him news about the murderer of","his father. The goldsmith knew full well that it was a tiger that","killed the king, and not any hunter's hands, since he had heard from","Gangazara how he obtained the crown. Still, he resolved to denounce","Gangazara as the king's murderer, so, hiding the crown under his","garments, he flew to the palace. He went before the prince and","informed him that the assassin was caught, and placed the crown before","him. The prince took it into his hands, examined it, and at once gave","half the kingdom to Manikkasari, and then inquired about the murderer.","\"He is bathing in the river, and is of such and such appearance,\" was","the reply. At once four armed soldiers flew to the river, and bound","the poor Brahman hand and foot, while he, sitting in meditation, was","without any knowledge of the fate that hung over him. They brought","Gangazara to the presence of the prince, who turned his face away from","the supposed murderer, and asked his soldiers to throw him into a","dungeon. In a minute, without knowing the cause, the poor Brahman","found himself in the dark dungeon.","","It was a dark cellar underground, built with strong stone walls, into","which any criminal guilty of a capital offence was ushered to breathe","his last there without food and drink. Such was the cellar into which","Gangazara was thrust. What were his thoughts when he reached that","place? \"It is of no use to accuse either the goldsmith or the prince","now. We are all the children of fate. We must obey her commands. This","is but the first day of my father's prophecy. So far his statement is","true. But how am I going to pass ten years here? Perhaps without","anything to sustain life I may drag on my existence for a day or two.","But how pass ten years? That cannot be, and I must die. Before death","comes let me think of my faithful brute friends.\"","","So pondered Gangazara in the dark cell underground, and at that moment","thought of his three friends. The tiger-king, serpent-king, and","rat-king assembled at once with their armies at a garden near the","dungeon, and for a while did not know what to do. They held their","council, and decided to make an underground passage from the inside","of a ruined well to the dungeon. The rat raja issued an order at once","to that effect to his army. They, with their teeth, bored the ground a","long way to the walls of the prison. After reaching it they found that","their teeth could not work on the hard stones. The bandicoots were","then specially ordered for the business; they, with their hard teeth,","made a small slit in the wall for a rat to pass and repass without","difficulty. Thus a passage was effected.","","The rat raja entered first to condole with his protector on his","misfortune, and undertook to supply his protector with provisions.","\"Whatever sweetmeats or bread are prepared in any house, one and all","of you must try to bring whatever you can to our benefactor. Whatever","clothes you find hanging in a house, cut down, dip the pieces in","water, and bring the wet bits to our benefactor. He will squeeze them","and gather water for drink! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form","his food.\" Having issued these orders, the king of the rats took leave","of Gangazara. They, in obedience to their king's order, continued to","supply him with provisions and water.","","The snake-king said: \"I sincerely condole with you in your calamity;","the tiger-king also fully sympathises with you, and wants me to tell","you so, as he cannot drag his huge body here as we have done with our","small ones. The king of the rats has promised to do his best to","provide you with food. We would now do what we can for your release.","From this day we shall issue orders to our armies to oppress all the","subjects of this kingdom. The deaths by snake-bite and tigers shall","increase a hundredfold from this day, and day by day it shall continue","to increase till your release. Whenever you hear people near you, you","had better bawl out so as to be heard by them: 'The wretched prince","imprisoned me on the false charge of having killed his father, while","it was a tiger that killed him. From that day these calamities have","broken out in his dominions. If I were released I would save all by my","powers of healing poisonous wounds and by incantations.' Some one may","report this to the king, and if he knows it, you will obtain your","liberty.\" Thus comforting his protector in trouble, he advised him to","pluck up courage, and took leave of him. From that day tigers and","serpents, acting under the orders of their kings, united in killing as","many persons and cattle as possible. Every day people were carried","away by tigers or bitten by serpents. Thus passed months and years.","Gangazara sat in the dark cellar, without the sun's light falling upon","him, and feasted upon the breadcrumbs and sweetmeats that the rats so","kindly supplied him with. These delicacies had completely changed his","body into a red, stout, huge, unwieldy mass of flesh. Thus passed full","ten years, as prophesied in the horoscope.","","Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last","evening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber","of the princess and sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was","the only daughter of the king. The king at once sent for all the","snake-bite curers. He promised half his kingdom and his daughter's","hand to him who would restore her to life. Now a servant of the king","who had several times overheard Gangazara's cries, reported the matter","to him. The king at once ordered the cell to be examined. There was","the man sitting in it. How had he managed to live so long in the cell?","Some whispered that he must be a divine being. Thus they discussed,","while they brought Gangazara to the king.","","The king no sooner saw Gangazara than he fell on the ground. He was","struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person. His ten years'","imprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a sort of lustre","to his body. His hair had first to be cut before his face could be","seen. The king begged forgiveness for his former fault, and requested","him to revive his daughter.","","\"Bring me within an hour all the corpses of men and cattle, dying and","dead, that remain unburnt or unburied within the range of your","dominions; I shall revive them all,\" were the only words that","Gangazara spoke.","","Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.","Even graves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a day or","two before were taken out and sent for their revival. As soon as all","were ready, Gangazara took a vessel full of water and sprinkled it","over them all, thinking only of his snake-king and tiger-king. All","rose up as if from deep slumber, and went to their respective homes.","The princess, too, was restored to life. The joy of the king knew no","bounds. He cursed the day on which he imprisoned him, blamed himself","for having believed the word of a goldsmith, and offered him the hand","of his daughter and the whole kingdom, instead of half, as he","promised. Gangazara would not accept anything, but asked the king to","assemble all his subjects in a wood near the town. \"I shall there call","in all the tigers and serpents, and give them a general order.\"","","When the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening,","Gangazara sat dumb for a moment, and thought upon the Tiger King and","the Serpent King, who came with all their armies. People began to take","to their heels at the sight of tigers. Gangazara assured them of","safety, and stopped them.","","The grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of Gangazara, the","holy ashes scattered lavishly over his body, the tigers and snakes","humbling themselves at his feet, gave him the true majesty of the god","Gangazara. For who else by a single word could thus command vast","armies of tigers and serpents, said some among the people. \"Care not","for it; it may be by magic. That is not a great thing. That he revived","cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely Gangazara,\" said others.","","\"Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects of","Ujjaini? Reply to me, and henceforth desist from your ravages.\" Thus","said the Soothsayer's son, and the following reply came from the king","of the tigers: \"Why should this base king imprison your honour,","believing the mere word of a goldsmith that your honour killed his","father? All the hunters told him that his father was carried away by a","tiger. I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck.","I did it, and gave the crown to your honour. The prince makes no","inquiry, and at once imprisons your honour. How can we expect justice","from such a stupid king as that? Unless he adopt a better standard of","justice we will go on with our destruction.\"","","The king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a","goldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his","crime, asked a thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from","that day. The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe","their oath as long as justice prevailed, and took their leave. The","goldsmith fled for his life. He was caught by the soldiers of the","king, and was pardoned by the generous Gangazara, whose voice now","reigned supreme. All returned to their homes.","","The king again pressed Gangazara to accept the hand of his daughter.","He agreed to do so, not then, but some time afterwards. He wished to","go and see his elder brother first, and then to return and marry the","princess. The king agreed; and Gangazara left the city that very day","on his way home.","","It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road, and had to pass","near a sea-coast. His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares","by that very same route. They met and recognised each other, even at a","distance. They flew into each other's arms. Both remained still for a","time almost unconscious with joy. The pleasure of Gangazara was so","great that he died of joy.","","The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa. That was a","Friday, a day very sacred to that god. The elder brother took the","corpse to the nearest Ganesa temple and called upon him. The god came,","and asked him what he wanted. \"My poor brother is dead and gone; and","this is his corpse. Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish","worshipping you. If I leave it anywhere else the devils may snatch it","away when I am absent worshipping you; after finishing the rites I","shall burn him.\" Thus said the elder brother, and, giving the corpse","to the god Ganesa, he went to prepare himself for that deity's","ceremonials. Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas, asking them to","watch over it carefully. But instead of that they devoured it.","","The elder brother, after finishing the puja, demanded his brother's","corpse of the god. The god called his Ganas, who came to the front","blinking, and fearing the anger of their master. The god was greatly","enraged. The elder brother was very angry. When the corpse was not","forthcoming he cuttingly remarked, \"Is this, after all, the return for","my deep belief in you? You are unable even to return my brother's","corpse.\" Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark. So he, by his divine","power, gave him a living Gangazara instead of the dead corpse. Thus","was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.","","The brothers had a long talk about each other's adventures. They both","went to Ujjaini, where Gangazara married the princess, and succeeded","to the throne of that kingdom. He reigned for a long time, conferring","several benefits upon his brother. And so the horoscope was fully","fulfilled.","","[Illustration:]","","","","","Harisarman","","","There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman. He","was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he","had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds","in a former life. He wandered about begging with his family, and at","last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich","householder called Sthuladatta. His sons became keepers of","Sthuladatta's cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him,","and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an","attendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the","daughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the","bridegroom, and merry-makers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able","to fill himself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other","dainties, and get the same for his family, in the house of his patron.","While he was anxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him.","","[Illustration:]","","Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his","wife at night, \"It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am","treated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an","artifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an","object of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an","opportunity, tell him that I possess magical knowledge.\" He said this","to her, and after turning the matter over in his mind, while people","were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on","which his master's son-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at","some distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could","not find the horse, though they searched in every direction. Then,","while Sthuladatta was distressed at the evil omen, and searching for","the thieves who had carried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came","and said to him, \"My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and","magical sciences; he can get the horse back for you; why do you not","ask him?\" When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who","said, \"Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is stolen,","I am called to mind,\" and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman","with these words--\"I forgot you, forgive me\"--and asked him to tell","him who had taken away their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of","pretended diagrams, and said: \"The horse has been placed by thieves on","the boundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and","before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day,","go quickly and bring it.\" When they heard that, many men ran and","brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Harisarman.","Then Harisarman was honoured by all men as a sage, and dwelt there in","happiness, honoured by Sthuladatta.","","Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been","stolen by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not","known, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his","reputation for knowledge of magic. And he, when summoned, tried to","gain time, and said, \"I will tell you to-morrow,\" and then he was","placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was sad","because he had pretended to have knowledge. Now in that palace there","was a maid named Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the assistance","of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the","palace. She, being alarmed at Harisarman's knowledge, went at night","and applied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out","what he was about. And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that","very moment blaming his own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of","knowledge. He said: \"O Tongue, what is this that you have done","through your greediness? Wicked one, you will soon receive punishment","in full.\" When Jihva heard this, she thought, in her terror, that she","had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed to get in where","he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed wizard:","\"Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the","thief of the treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in","a garden behind the palace, under a pomegranate tree. So spare me, and","receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession.\"","","When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly: \"Depart, I know","all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce","you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But","whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me.\" When he","said this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But","Harisarman reflected in his astonishment: \"Fate brings about, as if in","sport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would","have thought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming","my jihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret","crimes manifest themselves by means of fear.\" Thus thinking, he passed","the night happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the","king, by some skilful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden,","and led him up to the treasure, which was buried under the pomegranate","tree, and said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the","king was pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages.","","But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king's ear: \"How","can a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having","studied the books of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen","of the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret","intelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some","new artifice.\" Then the king of his own accord brought a covered","pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman,","\"Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do","you great honour to-day.\" When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he","thought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet","name of \"Froggie\" which his father had given him in his childhood in","sport, and, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name,","lamenting his hard fate, and suddenly called out: \"This is a fine","pitcher for you, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of","your helpless self.\" The people there, when they heard him say that,","raised a shout of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with","the object presented to him, and murmured, \"Ah! a great sage, he knows","even about the frog!\" Then the king, thinking that this was all due to","knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the","revenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages","of all kinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world.","","","","","The Charmed Ring","","","A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade","him go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the","money and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some","herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill.","\"Please do not kill the dog,\" pleaded the young and tender-hearted","fellow; \"I will give you one hundred rupees for it.\" Then and there,","of course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the","dog, and continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting","about a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. \"Oh!","please do not kill it,\" said he; \"I will give you one hundred rupees","for it.\" Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money.","He went on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling","over a snake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill","it, but others did not. \"Please do not kill the snake,\" said he; \"I","will give you one hundred rupees.\" Of course the people agreed, and","were highly delighted.","","What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money","was gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he","went home.","","\"You fool! You scamp!\" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his","son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. \"Go and live","in the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter","my house.\"","","So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass","spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and","the snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very","fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by","him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head,","and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its","tail on the other.","","One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, \"I am","the son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground","to drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had","you not most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I","shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would","that you knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son's","preserver!\"","","\"Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,\" said the","young man.","","\"Well said!\" continued the snake. \"Do you see yonder mountain? At the","bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come","with me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's","country. Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward","you, too. But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to","accept something at his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you","would, perhaps, do well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and","the famous pot and spoon which you possess.' With these in your","possession, you would never need anything, for the ring is such that a","man has only to speak to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished","mansion will be provided for him, while the pot and the spoon will","supply him with all manner of the rarest and most delicious foods.\"","","Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and","prepared to jump in, according to the snake's directions. \"O master!\"","exclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do.","\"What shall we do? Where shall we go?\"","","\"Wait for me here,\" he replied. \"I am not going far. I shall not be","long away.\" On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to","sight.","","\"Now what shall we do?\" said the dog to the cat.","","\"We must remain here,\" replied the cat, \"as our master ordered. Do not","be anxious about food. I will go to the people's houses and get plenty","of food for both of us.\" And so the cat did, and they both lived very","comfortably till their master came again and joined them.","","The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and","information of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness","commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake","refused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was","released from this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible","death, and whose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and","embraced his son, and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his","dominions. The young man stayed there a few days, during which he","received the Raja's right-hand ring, and the pot and spoon, in","recognition of His Highness's gratitude to him for having delivered","his son. He then returned. On reaching the top of the spring he found","his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting for him. They told one","another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other,","and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked together to the river","side, where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and","pot and spoon.","","The merchant's son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful","house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the","pot and spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were","provided for them. So he married the princess, and they lived very","happily for several years, until one morning the princess, while","arranging her toilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed","and threw them into the river that flowed along under the window. The","reed floated on the water for many miles, and was at last picked up by","the prince of that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden","hair. On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked","himself up in his room, and would not leave it. He had fallen","desperately in love with the woman whose hair he had picked up, and","refused to eat, or drink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to","him. The king, his father, was in great distress about the matter, and","did not know what to do. He feared lest his son should die and leave","him without an heir. At last he determined to seek the counsel of his","aunt, who was an ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and","bade him not to be anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed","in getting the beautiful woman for his son's wife.","","She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing,","and buzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful","princess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a","stick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful","princess and said, \"I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before,","because I left the country just after your birth.\" She also embraced","and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The","beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress's","embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she","could, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress","thought to herself, \"I shall soon accomplish my errand.\" When she had","been in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring,","and advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter","was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and","might lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband","for the ring, and he readily gave it to her.","","The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious","thing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the","ogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away","with it to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point","of death. \"Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,\" she said to him. \"The","woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the","charm, whereby you may bring her before you.\" The prince was almost","mad with joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing","the beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the","house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace","garden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful","princess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no","escape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he","would wait one month for her.","","Meanwhile the merchant's son had returned from hunting and was","terribly distressed not to find his house and wife. There was the","place only, just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring","which Raja Indrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put","an end to himself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone","away and hidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything","disappear. \"O master!\" they said, \"stay your hand. Your trial is","great, but it can be remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and","try to recover your wife and house.\"","","\"Go,\" said he, \"and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my","wife, and I shall live.\"","","So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they","reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken.","\"We may have some difficulty here,\" said the cat. \"Look, the king has","taken our master's wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will","go to the house and try to see her.\" So the dog sat down, and the cat","climbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess","was sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and","informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them.","","\"But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?\" she","asked.","","\"Yes,\" replied the cat, \"if you can tell me where the charmed ring","is.\"","","\"The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,\" she said.","","\"All right,\" said the cat, \"I will recover it. If we once get it,","everything is ours.\" Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and","went and laid down by a rat's hole and pretended she was dead. Now at","that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat","community of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were","assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down.","The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The","cat got to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the","bridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently,","when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping","in honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and","pounced down on him. \"Oh! let me go, let me go,\" cried the terrified","rat. \"Oh! let him go,\" squealed all the company. \"It is his wedding","day.\"","","\"No, no,\" replied the cat. \"Not unless you do something for me.","Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his","wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will","procure it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do","not, then your prince dies under my feet.\"","","\"Very well, we agree,\" said they all. \"Nay, if we do not get the ring","for you, devour us all.\"","","[Illustration: THE CHARMED RING]","","This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the","thing. At midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats","went to her bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail","into her throat; whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring","came out and rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the","precious thing and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and","went at once to the cat and released its son.","","As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to","go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They","had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the","house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything","would go on as happily as before. \"How glad master will be!\" they","thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the","way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its","back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring,","and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it","up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at","once dropped it, and a fish swallowed it.","","\"Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?\" said the dog.","","\"What is done is done,\" replied the cat. \"We must try to recover it,","and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream.","I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me.\"","","\"All right,\" said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with","a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and","lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.","Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones","of a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down","on it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the","bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.","This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off","to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to","restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was","found and carried back to the cat.","","\"Come along now; I have got the ring,\" said the cat to the dog.","","\"No, I will not,\" said the dog, \"unless you let me have the ring. I","can carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you.\" So","the cat was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon","dropped it again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a","kite.","","\"See, see, there it goes--away to that big tree,\" the cat exclaimed.","","\"Oh! oh! what have I done?\" cried the dog.","","\"You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,\" said the cat. \"But stop","your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where","we shall not be able to trace it.\"","","The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree,","killed the kite, and recovered the ring. \"Come along,\" it said to the","dog when it reached the ground. \"We must make haste now. We have been","delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on.\"","","The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for","all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the","third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and","gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into","joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house","reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be.","","","","","The Talkative Tortoise","","","The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when","Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became","the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual.","","Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no","opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this","talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing","so.","","At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a","tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there,","made friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate","with him, they said to the tortoise:","","\"Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount","Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come","there with us?\"","","\"But how can I get there?\"","","\"We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say","nothing to anybody.\"","","\"Oh! that I can do. Take me with you.\"","","\"That's right,\" said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a","stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up","into the air.","","Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, \"Two","wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!\" Whereupon the","tortoise wanted to say, \"If my friends choose to carry me, what is","that to you, you wretched slaves!\" So just as the swift flight of the","wild ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of","Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open","courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, \"A tortoise","has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!\"","","[Illustration:]","","The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by","his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat,","\"Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?\"","","The future Buddha thought to himself, \"Long expecting, wishing to","admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This","tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must","have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air","to take him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue","when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something,","and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and","thus lost his life.\" And saying, \"Truly, O king! those who are called","chatter-boxes--people whose words have no end--come to grief like","this,\" he uttered these Verses:","","    \"Verily the tortoise killed himself","    Whilst uttering his voice;","    Though he was holding tight the stick,","    By a word himself he slew.","","    \"Behold him then, O excellent by strength!","    And speak wise words, not out of season.","    You see how, by his talking overmuch,","    The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!\"","","The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, \"O Teacher!","are you speaking of us?\"","","And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, \"O great king! be it thou, or","be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap","like this.\"","","And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few","words.","","","","","A Lac of Rupees for a Bit of Advice","","[Illustration:]","","","A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for","their subsistence. Every day the young fellow used to go out and get","what he could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last","he became quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go","and try his luck in another country. He informed his wife of his","intention, and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old","people during the few months that he would be absent. He begged her to","be industrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him.","","One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day","after day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country.","Here he went and sat down by a merchant's shop and asked alms. The","merchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was","his caste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was","wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife","and parents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to","visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered to","accompany him to the court. Now at that time it happened that the king","was seeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had","just had built. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the","Brahman and heard that he was good and honest. He at once deputed him","to the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and","one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages.","","Two months after this, the Brahman's wife, not having heard any news","of her husband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy","fate she arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she","heard that every morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given","in the king's name to any beggar who chose to go for it. Accordingly,","on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband.","","\"Why have you come here?\" he asked. \"Why have you left my parents?","Care you not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and","await my return.\"","","\"No, no,\" said the woman. \"I cannot go back to starve and see your old","father and mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the","house.\"","","\"O Bhagawant!\" exclaimed the Brahman. \"Here, take this,\" he continued,","scribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, \"and","give it to the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of","rupees for it.\" Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left.","","On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice--First, If","a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him","be careful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he","close them in death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and","visits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what","she can obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will","frown on him and disown him. Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he","must do it himself, and do it with might and without fear.","","On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with","her husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but","not liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her","relations. The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be","flogged, dismissed him. The next morning the Brahmani took the paper,","and while she was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the","king's son met her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she","replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain bits of","advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to","show it to him, and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the","amount, and rode on. The poor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she","laid in a great store of provisions, sufficient to last them all for a","long time.","","In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the","woman, and the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father","would applaud the act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than","before, and banished his son from the country.","","So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends, and","rode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall he","arrived at some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge","at his house. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like","a prince. Matting was spread for him to squat on, and the best","provisions set before him.","","\"Ah!\" thought he, as he lay down to rest, \"here is a case for the","first piece of advice that the Brahmani gave me. I will not sleep","to-night.\"","","It was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the","man rose up, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with","the intention of killing him. But he rose up and spoke.","","\"Do not slay me,\" he said. \"What profit would you get from my death?","If you killed me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who","killed his dog.\"","","\"What man? What dog?\" he asked.","","\"I will tell you,\" said the prince, \"if you will give me that sword.\"","","So he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:","","\"Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He","was suddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got","a loan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the","dog as a pledge, and with the money began business again. Not long","after this the other merchant's shop was broken into by thieves and","completely sacked. There was hardly ten rupees' worth left in the","place. The faithful dog, however, knew what was going on, and went and","followed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the things, and","then returned.","","\"In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the","merchant's house when it was known what had happened. The merchant","himself nearly went mad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the","door, and pulling at his master's shirt and paijamas, as though","wishing him to go outside. At last a friend suggested that, perhaps,","the dog knew something of the whereabouts of the things, and advised","the merchant to follow its leadings. The merchant consented, and went","after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden","the goods. Here the animal scraped and barked, and showed in various","ways that the things were underneath. So the merchant and his friends","dug about the place, and soon came upon all the stolen property.","Nothing was missing. There was everything just as the thieves had","taken them.","","\"The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once","sent the dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the","collar, wherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast, and","begged his friend to forget the loan and to accept another five","thousand rupees as a present. When this merchant saw his dog coming","back again, he thought, 'Alas! my friend is wanting the money. How can","I pay him? I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my","recent losses. I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold, and","say that another must have slain it. Thus there will be an end of my","debt. No dog, no loan.' Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor","dog, when the letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up","and read it. How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew","the facts of the case!","","\"Beware,\" continued the prince, \"lest you do that which afterwards you","would give your life not to have done.\"","","By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning,","and he went away, after rewarding the man.","","The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.","He disguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the","palace, pretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of","his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested","in him, as his wife was very ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure","her, but in vain. He thought that, perhaps, this holy man could do","something for her. So he sent to him. But the jogi refused to tread","the halls of a king, saying that his dwelling was the open air, and","that if his Majesty wished to see him he must come himself and bring","his wife to the place. Then the king took his wife and brought her to","the jogi. The holy man bade her prostrate herself before him, and when","she had remained in this position for about three hours, he told her","to rise and go, for she was cured.","","In the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because","the queen had lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about","it. At length some one went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by","the place where the queen had prostrated herself. When the king heard","this he was very angry, and ordered the jogi to be executed. This","stern order, however, was not carried out, as the prince bribed the","men and escaped from the country. But he knew that the second bit of","advice was true.","","Clad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he","saw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and","children. \"O fool,\" said he, \"what is the matter? If you laugh, why do","you weep? If you weep, why do you laugh?\"","","\"Do not bother me,\" said the potter. \"What does it matter to you?\"","","\"Pardon me,\" said the prince, \"but I should like to know the reason.\"","","\"The reason is this, then,\" said the potter. \"The king of this country","has a daughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her","husbands die the first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the","young men of the place have thus perished, and our son will be called","on soon. We laugh at the absurdity of the thing--a potter's son","marrying a princess, and we cry at the terrible consequence of the","marriage. What can we do?\"","","\"Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more,\" said the","prince. \"I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to","the princess instead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and","prepare me for the occasion.\"","","So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince","went to the palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the","princess. \"Dread hour!\" thought he; \"am I to die like the scores of","young men before me?\" He clenched his sword with firm grip, and lay","down on his bed, intending to keep awake all the night and see what","would happen. In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out","from the nostrils of the princess. They stole over towards him,","intending to kill him, like the others who had been before him: but he","was ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes","reached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the","king came as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter","and the prince talking gaily together. \"Surely,\" said he, \"this man","must be her husband, as he only can live with her.\"","","\"Where do you come from? Who are you?\" asked the king, entering the","room.","","\"O king!\" replied the prince, \"I am the son of a king who rules over","such-and-such a country.\"","","When he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to","abide in his palace, and appointed him his successor to the throne.","The prince remained at the palace for more than a year, and then asked","permission to visit his own country, which was granted. The king gave","him elephants, horses, jewels, and abundance of money for the expenses","of the way and as presents for his father, and the prince started.","","On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his","brother-in-law, whom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival","reached the ears of the king, who came with rope-tied hands and","haltered neck to do him homage. He most humbly begged him to stay at","his palace, and to accept what little hospitality could be provided.","While the prince was staying at the palace he saw his sister, who","greeted him with smiles and kisses. On leaving he told her how she and","her husband had treated him at his first visit, and how he had","escaped; and then gave them two elephants, two beautiful horses,","fifteen soldiers, and ten lacs rupees' worth of jewels.","","Afterwards he went to his own home, and informed his mother and father","of his arrival. Alas! his parents had both become blind from weeping","about the loss of their son. \"Let him come in,\" said the king, \"and","put his hands upon our eyes, and we shall see again.\" So the prince","entered, and was most affectionately greeted by his old parents; and","he laid his hands on their eyes, and they saw again.","","Then the prince told his father all that had happened to him, and how","he had been saved several times by attending to the advice that he had","purchased from the Brahmani. Whereupon the king expressed his sorrow","for having sent him away, and all was joy and peace again.","","","","","The Gold-giving Serpent","","","Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta. He was a","farmer, but poor was the return his labour brought him. One day, at","the end of the hot hours, the Brahman, overcome by the heat, lay down","under the shadow of a tree to have a doze. Suddenly he saw a great","hooded snake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand. So he thought","to himself, \"Sure this is the guardian deity of the field, and I have","not ever worshipped it. That's why my farming is in vain. I will at","once go and pay my respects to it.\"","","When he had made up his mind, he got some milk, poured it into a bowl,","and went to the ant-hill, and said aloud: \"O Guardian of this Field!","all this while I did not know that you dwelt here. That is why I have","not yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me.\" And he laid the","milk down and went to his house. Next morning he came and looked, and","he saw a gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day","the same thing occurred: he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold","denar.","","One day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so he ordered his","son to take the milk to the ant-hill. The son brought the milk, put","it down, and went back home. Next day he went again and found a","denar, so he thought to himself: \"This ant-hill is surely full","of golden denars; I'll kill the serpent, and take them all for","myself.\" So next day, while he was giving the milk to the serpent, the","Brahman's son struck it on the head with a cudgel. But the serpent","escaped death by the will of fate, and in a rage bit the Brahman's son","with its sharp fangs, and he fell down dead at once. His people raised","him a funeral pyre not far from the field and burnt him to ashes.","","[Illustration:]","","Two days afterwards his father came back, and when he learnt his son's","fate he grieved and mourned. But after a time, he took the bowl of","milk, went to the ant-hill, and praised the serpent with a loud voice.","After a long, long time the serpent appeared, but only with its head","out of the opening of the ant-hill, and spoke to the Brahman: \"'Tis","greed that brings you here, and makes you even forget the loss of","your son. From this time forward friendship between us is impossible.","Your son struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have bitten him to","death. How can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can you","forget the pain and grief at the loss of your son?\" So speaking, it","gave the Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared. But before it went","away it said: \"Come back no more.\" The Brahman took the pearl, and","went back home, cursing the folly of his son.","","","","","The Son of Seven Queens","","","Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens, but no","children. This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered","that on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.","","Now it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King, and","said, \"Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and","one of your seven Queens shall bear a son.\"","","The King's delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders","for appropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event","throughout the length and breadth of the land.","","Meanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace,","attended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts'","content on sweetmeats and confectionery.","","Now the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started,","the seven Queens sent him a message saying, \"May it please our dearest","lord not to hunt towards the north to-day, for we have dreamt bad","dreams, and fear lest evil should befall you.\"","","[Illustration:]","","The King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes,","and set out towards the south; but as luck would have it, although he","hunted diligently, he found no game. Nor had he more success to the","east or west, so that, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to","go home empty-handed, he forgot all about his promise, and turned to","the north. Here also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had","made up his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden","horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket. So quickly did","it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless a burning desire to","capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast.","He instantly ordered his attendants to form a ring round the thicket,","and so encircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he","pressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in","the midst. Nearer and nearer he advanced, till, just as he thought to","lay hold of the beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound,","leapt clean over the King's head, and fled towards the mountains.","Forgetful of all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed","at full speed. On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue far behind,","keeping the white hind in view, never drawing bridle, until, finding","himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in his steed.","Before him stood a miserable hovel, into which, being tired after his","long, unsuccessful chase, he entered to ask for a drink of water. An","old woman, seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request","by calling to her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came a","maiden so lovely and charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired,","that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a","sight in the wretched hovel.","","She held the vessel of water to the King's lips, and as he drank he","looked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl","was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet","he had chased so far.","","Her beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to","return with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven","Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage. However, when he","would take no refusal, but implored her to have pity on him, promising","her everything she could desire, she replied, \"Give me the eyes of","your seven Queens, and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you","say.\"","","The King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind's","magical beauty, that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven","Queens taken out, and, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a","noisome dungeon whence they could not escape, set off once more for","the hovel in the ravine, bearing with him his horrible offering. But","the white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes,","and threading them as a necklace, flung it round her mother's neck,","saying, \"Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, whilst I am away in","the King's palace.\"","","Then she went back with the bewitched monarch, as his bride, and he","gave her the seven Queens' rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven","Queens' palace to live in, and the seven Queens' slaves to wait upon","her; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire.","","Now, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes","torn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest","of the Queens. It was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very","jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate. But","though at first they disliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved","so useful to them, that ere long they all looked on him as their son.","Almost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud","wall of their dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had","made a hole big enough for him to crawl through. Through this he","disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats, which","he divided equally amongst the seven blind Queens.","","As he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three","times every day to play with the little nobles in the town. No one","knew who the tiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full","of funny tricks and antics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to","be rewarded by some girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some","sweetmeats. All these things he brought home to his seven mothers, as","he loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on in","their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death","ages before.","","At last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his bow and","arrow, and went out to seek for game. Coming by chance past the palace","where the white hind lived in wicked splendour and magnificence, he","saw some pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets, and,","taking good aim, shot one dead. It came tumbling past the very window","where the white Queen was sitting; she rose to see what was the","matter, and looked out. At the first glance of the handsome young lad","standing there bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that it was the","King's son.","","She nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy the lad","without delay; therefore, sending a servant to bring him to her","presence, she asked him if he would sell her the pigeon he had just","shot.","","\"No,\" replied the sturdy lad, \"the pigeon is for my seven blind","mothers, who live in the noisome dungeon, and who would die if I did","not bring them food.\"","","\"Poor souls!\" cried the cunning white witch; \"would you not like to","bring them their eyes again? Give me the pigeon, my dear, and I","faithfully promise to show you where to find them.\"","","Hearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and gave up the","pigeon at once. Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother","without delay, and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.","","\"She will not fail to give them,\" said the cruel Queen, \"if you show","her this token on which I have written what I want done.\"","","So saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with these","words inscribed on it--\"Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his","blood like water!\"","","Now, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took the fatal","message cheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen's mother.","","Whilst he was journeying he passed through a town, where every one of","the inhabitants looked so sad, that he could not help asking what was","the matter. They told him it was because the King's only daughter","refused to marry; so when her father died there would be no heir to","the throne. They greatly feared she must be out of her mind, for","though every good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown to","her, she declared she would only marry one who was the son of seven","mothers, and who ever heard of such a thing? The King, in despair, had","ordered every man who entered the city gates to be led before the","Princess; so, much to the lad's impatience, for he was in an immense","hurry to find his mothers' eyes, he was dragged into the","presence-chamber.","","No sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed, and,","turning to the King, said, \"Dear father, this is my choice!\"","","Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.","","[Illustration: THE SON OF SEVEN MOTHERS]","","The inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven","Queens said he would not marry the Princess unless they first let him","recover his mothers' eyes. When the beautiful bride heard his story,","she asked to see the potsherd, for she was very learned and clever.","Seeing the treacherous words, she said nothing, but taking another","similar-shaped bit of potsherd, she wrote on it these words--\"Take","care of this lad, giving him all he desires,\" and returned it to the","son of seven Queens, who, none the wiser, set off on his quest.","","Ere long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch's","mother, a hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully on reading the","message, especially when the lad asked for the necklace of eyes.","Nevertheless she took it off, and gave it him, saying, \"There are only","thirteen of 'em now, for I lost one last week.\"","","The lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so he hurried","home as fast as he could to his seven mothers, and gave two eyes","apiece to the six elder Queens; but to the youngest he gave one,","saying, \"Dearest little mother!--I will be your other eye always!\"","","After this he set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised, but","when passing by the white Queen's palace he saw some pigeons on the","roof. Drawing his bow, he shot one, and it came fluttering past the","window. The white hind looked out, and lo! there was the King's son","alive and well.","","She cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the lad, asked him","how he had returned so soon, and when she heard how he had brought","home the thirteen eyes, and given them to the seven blind Queens, she","could hardly restrain her rage. Nevertheless she pretended to be","charmed with his success, and told him that if he would give her this","pigeon also, she would reward him with the Jogi's wonderful cow, whose","milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big as a kingdom. The","lad, nothing loth, gave her the pigeon; whereupon, as before, she bade","him go ask her mother for the cow, and gave him a potsherd whereon was","written--\"Kill this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood like","water!\"","","But on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the Princess, just","to tell her how he came to be delayed, and she, after reading the","message on the potsherd, gave him another in its stead; so that when","the lad reached the old hag's hut and asked her for the Jogi's cow,","she could not refuse, but told the boy how to find it; and bidding him","of all things not to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who","kept watch and ward over the treasure, told him to be off before she","became too angry at her daughter's foolishness in thus giving away so","many good things.","","Then the lad did as he had been told bravely. He journeyed on and on","till he came to a milk-white pond, guarded by the eighteen thousand","demons. They were really frightful to behold, but, plucking up","courage, he whistled a tune as he walked through them, looking neither","to the right nor the left. By-and-by he came upon the Jogi's cow,","tall, white, and beautiful, while the Jogi himself, who was king of","all the demons, sat milking her day and night, and the milk streamed","from her udder, filling the milk-white tank.","","The Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, \"What do you want","here?\"","","Then the lad answered, according to the old hag's bidding, \"I want","your skin, for King Indra is making a new kettle-drum, and says your","skin is nice and tough.\"","","Upon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn or Jogi","dares disobey King Indra's command), and, falling at the lad's feet,","cried, \"If you will spare me I will give you anything I possess, even","my beautiful white cow!\"","","To this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended hesitation,","agreed, saying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice","tough skin like the Jogi's elsewhere; so, driving the wonderful cow","before him, he set off homewards. The seven Queens were delighted to","possess so marvellous an animal, and though they toiled from morning","till night making curds and whey, besides selling milk to the","confectioners, they could not use half the cow gave, and became richer","and richer day by day.","","Seeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens started with a","light heart to marry the Princess; but when passing the white hind's","palace he could not resist sending a bolt at some pigeons which were","cooing on the parapet. One fell dead just beneath the window where the","white Queen was sitting. Looking out, she saw the lad hale and hearty","standing before her, and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.","","She sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and when she","heard how kindly her mother had received him, she very nearly had a","fit; however, she dissembled her feelings as well as she could, and,","smiling sweetly, said she was glad to have been able to fulfil her","promise, and that if he would give her this third pigeon, she would do","yet more for him than she had done before, by giving him the","million-fold rice, which ripens in one night.","","The lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving up the","pigeon, set off on his quest, armed as before with a potsherd, on","which was written, \"Do not fail this time. Kill the lad, and sprinkle","his blood like water!\"","","But when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her becoming","anxious about him, she asked to see the potsherd as usual, and","substituted another, on which was written, \"Yet again give this lad","all he requires, for his blood shall be as your blood!\"","","Now when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad wanted the","million-fold rice which ripens in a single night, she fell into the","most furious rage, but being terribly afraid of her daughter, she","controlled herself, and bade the boy go and find the field guarded by","eighteen millions of demons, warning him on no account to look back","after having plucked the tallest spike of rice, which grew in the","centre.","","So the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the field where,","guarded by eighteen millions of demons, the million-fold rice grew. He","walked on bravely, looking neither to the right or left, till he","reached the centre and plucked the tallest ear, but as he turned","homewards a thousand sweet voices rose behind him, crying in tenderest","accents, \"Pluck me too! oh, please pluck me too!\" He looked back, and","lo! there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes!","","Now as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old hag grew","uneasy, remembering the message \"his blood shall be as your blood\"; so","she set off to see what had happened.","","Soon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her arts what it","was, she took a little water, and kneading the ashes into a paste,","formed it into the likeness of a man; then, putting a drop of blood","from her little finger into its mouth, she blew on it, and instantly","the son of seven Queens started up as well as ever.","","\"Don't you disobey orders again!\" grumbled the old hag, \"or next time","I'll leave you alone. Now be off, before I repent of my kindness!\"","","[Illustration:]","","So the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven mothers,","who, by the aid of the million-fold rice, soon became the richest","people in the kingdom. Then they celebrated their son's marriage to","the clever Princess with all imaginable pomp; but the bride was so","clever, she would not rest until she had made known her husband to his","father, and punished the wicked white witch. So she made her husband","build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven Queens had","lived, and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendour. Then, when","all was prepared, she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King.","Now the King had heard much of the mysterious son of seven Queens, and","his marvellous wealth, so he gladly accepted the invitation; but what","was his astonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a","facsimile of his own in every particular! And when his host, richly","attired, led him straight to the private hall, where on royal thrones","sat the seven Queens, dressed as he had last seen them, he was","speechless with surprise, until the Princess, coming forward, threw","herself at his feet, and told him the whole story. Then the King awoke","from his enchantment, and his anger rose against the wicked white hind","who had bewitched him so long, until he could not contain himself. So","she was put to death, and her grave ploughed over, and after that the","seven Queens returned to their own splendid palace, and everybody","lived happily.","","","","","A Lesson for Kings","","[Illustration:]","","","Once upon a time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the","future Buddha returned to life as his son and heir. And when the day","came for choosing a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew","up in due course; and when he was sixteen years old, went to","Takkasila, and became accomplished in all arts. And after his father","died he ascended the throne, and ruled the kingdom with righteousness","and equity. He gave judgments without partiality, hatred, ignorance,","or fear. Since he thus reigned with justice, with justice also his","ministers administered the law. Law-suits being thus decided with","justice, there were none who brought false cases. And as these ceased,","the noise and tumult of litigation ceased in the king's court. Though","the judges sat all day in the court, they had to leave without any one","coming for justice. It came to this, that the Hall of Justice would","have to be closed!","","Then the future Buddha thought, \"It cannot be from my reigning with","righteousness that none come for judgment; the bustle has ceased, and","the Hall of Justice will have to be closed. I must, therefore, now","examine into my own faults; and if I find that anything is wrong in","me, put that away, and practise only virtue.\"","","Thenceforth he sought for some one to tell him his faults, but among","those around him he found no one who would tell him of any fault, but","heard only his own praise.","","Then he thought, \"It is from fear of me that these men speak only good","things, and not evil things,\" and he sought among those people who","lived outside the palace. And finding no fault-finder there, he sought","among those who lived outside the city, in the suburbs, at the four","gates. And there too finding no one to find fault, and hearing only","his own praise, he determined to search the country places.","","So he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot;","and taking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise. And","searching the country through, up to the very boundary, he found no","fault-finder, and heard only of his own virtue; and so he turned back","from the outer-most boundary, and returned by the high road towards","the city.","","Now at that time the king of Kosala, Mallika by name, was also ruling","his kingdom with righteousness; and when seeking for some fault in","himself, he also found no fault-finder in the palace but only heard of","his own virtue! So seeking in country places, he too came to that","very spot. And these two came face to face in a low cart-track with","precipitous sides, where there was no space for a chariot to get out","of the way!","","Then the charioteer of Mallika the king said to the charioteer of the","king of Benares, \"Take thy chariot out of the way!\"","","But he said, \"Take thy chariot out of the way, O charioteer! In this","chariot sitteth the lord over the kingdom of Benares, the great king","Brahma-datta.\"","","Yet the other replied, \"In this chariot, O charioteer, sitteth the","lord over the kingdom of Kosala, the great king Mallika. Take thy","carriage out of the way, and make room for the chariot of our king!\"","","Then the charioteer of the king of Benares thought, \"They say then","that he too is a king! What _is_ now to be done?\" After some","consideration, he said to himself, \"I know a way. I'll find out how","old he is, and then I'll let the chariot of the younger be got out of","the way, and so make room for the elder.\"","","And when he had arrived at that conclusion, he asked that charioteer","what the age of the king of Kosala was. But on inquiry he found that","the ages of both were equal. Then he inquired about the extent of his","kingdom, and about his army, and his wealth, and his renown, and about","the country he lived in, and his caste and tribe and family. And he","found that both were lords of a kingdom three hundred leagues in","extent; and that in respect of army and wealth and renown, and the","countries in which they lived, and their caste and their tribe and","their family, they were just on a par!","","Then he thought, \"I will make way for the most righteous.\" And he","asked, \"What kind of righteousness has this king of yours?\"","","Then the chorister of the king of Kosala, proclaiming his king's","wickedness as goodness, uttered the First Stanza:","","    \"The strong he overthrows by strength,","    The mild by mildness, does Mallika;","    The good he conquers by goodness,","    And the wicked by wickedness too.","      Such is the nature of _this_ king!","      Move out of the way, O charioteer!\"","","But the charioteer of the king of Benares asked him, \"Well, have you","told all the virtues of your king?\"","","\"Yes,\" said the other.","","\"If these are his _virtues_, where are then his faults?\" replied he.","","The other said, \"Well, for the nonce, they shall be faults, if you","like! But pray, then, what is the kind of goodness your king has?\"","","And then the charioteer of the king of Benares called unto him to","hearken, and uttered the Second Stanza:","","    \"Anger he conquers by calmness,","    And by goodness the wicked;","    The stingy he conquers by gifts,","    And by truth the speaker of lies.","      Such is the nature of _this_ king!","      Move out of the way, O charioteer!\"","","And when he had thus spoken, both Mallika the king and his charioteer","alighted from their chariot. And they took out the horses, and removed","their chariot, and made way for the king of Benares!","","","","","Pride goeth before a Fall","","","In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants, who always went","about together. Once upon a time they had travelled far afield, and","were returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained","by selling their wares. Now there happened to be a dense forest near","their village, and this they reached early one morning. In it there","lived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had","never heard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers","stood before them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered","them to lay down all they had. The traders had no weapons with them,","and so, though they were many more in number, they had to submit","themselves to the robbers, who took away everything from them, even","the very clothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin-cloth a","span in breadth and a cubit in length.","","The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their","property, now took possession of the robbers' minds. They seated","themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and","ordered them to dance to them before returning home. The merchants","now mourned their fate. They had lost all they had, except their","loin-cloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them","to dance.","","There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever. He","pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the","dance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which","the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time","he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in","the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now","commencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song","is always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep","time with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:","","    \"We are enty men,","    They are erith men:","    If each erith man,","    Surround eno men","    Eno man remains.","    _Tâ, tai, tôm, tadingana._\"","","The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was","merely singing a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for the leader","commenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before he","and his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They had","understood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.","","When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a","purchaser, they use a riddling sort of language.","","[Illustration:]","","[Illustration:]","","\"What is the price of this cloth?\" one trader will ask another.","","\"Enty rupees,\" another will reply, meaning \"ten rupees.\"","","Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant","unless he be acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this","secret language erith means \"three,\" enty means \"ten,\" and eno means","\"one.\" So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders","that they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced","upon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the","remaining one bound the robbers' hands and feet.","","[Illustration:]","","[Illustration:]","","The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understanding","the meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were","proudly seated chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung","a third time. _Tâ tai tôm_ had left the lips of the singer; and,","before _tadingana_ was out of them, the traders separated into parties","of three, and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining one--the","leader himself--tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of","cloth, six cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers.","These were entirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three","bags of rice!","","The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselves","with the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reached","their village, they often amused their friends and relatives by","relating their adventure.","","","","","Raja Rasalu.","","","Once there lived a great Raja, whose name was Salabhan, and he had a","Queen, by name Lona, who, though she wept and prayed at many a shrine,","had never a child to gladden her eyes. After a long time, however, a","son was promised to her.","","Queen Lona returned to the palace, and when the time for the birth of","the promised son drew nigh, she inquired of three Jogis who came","begging to her gate, what the child's fate would be, and the youngest","of them answered and said, \"Oh, Queen! the child will be a boy, and he","will live to be a great man. But for twelve years you must not look","upon his face, for if either you or his father see it before the","twelve years are past, you will surely die! This is what you must do;","as soon as the child is born you must send him away to a cellar","underneath the ground, and never let him see the light of day for","twelve years. After they are over, he may come forth, bathe in the","river, put on new clothes, and visit you. His name shall be Raja","Rasalu, and he shall be known far and wide.\"","","So, when a fair young Prince was in due time born into the world, his","parents hid him away in an underground palace, with nurses, and","servants, and everything else a King's son might desire. And with him","they sent a young colt, born the same day, and sword, spear, and","shield, against the day when Raja Rasalu should go forth into the","world.","","So there the child lived, playing with his colt, and talking to his","parrot, while the nurses taught him all things needful for a King's","son to know.","","Young Rasalu lived on, far from the light of day, for eleven long","years, growing tall and strong, yet contented to remain playing with","his colt, and talking to his parrot; but when the twelfth year began,","the lad's heart leapt up with desire for change, and he loved to","listen to the sounds of life which came to him in his palace-prison","from the outside world.","","\"I must go and see where the voices come from!\" he said; and when his","nurses told him he must not go for one year more, he only laughed","aloud, saying, \"Nay! I stay no longer here for any man!\"","","Then he saddled his Arab horse Bhaunr, put on his shining armour, and","rode forth into the world; but mindful of what his nurses had oft told","him, when he came to the river, he dismounted, and, going into the","water, washed himself and his clothes.","","Then, clean of raiment, fair of face, and brave of heart, he rode on","his way until he reached his father's city. There he sat down to rest","awhile by a well, where the women were drawing water in earthen","pitchers. Now, as they passed him, their full pitchers poised upon","their heads, the gay young Prince flung stones at the earthen","vessels, and broke them all. Then the women, drenched with water,","went weeping and wailing to the palace, complaining to the King that a","mighty young Prince in shining armour, with a parrot on his wrist and","a gallant steed beside him, sat by the well, and broke their pitchers.","","Now, as soon as Rajah Salabhan heard this, he guessed at once that it","was Prince Rasalu come forth before the time, and, mindful of the","Jogis' words that he would die if he looked on his son's face before","twelve years were past, he did not dare to send his guards to seize","the offender and bring him to be judged. So he bade the women be","comforted, and take pitchers of iron and brass, giving new ones from","his treasury to those who did not possess any of their own.","","But when Prince Rasalu saw the women returning to the well with","pitchers of iron and brass, he laughed to himself, and drew his mighty","bow till the sharp-pointed arrows pierced the metal vessels as though","they had been clay.","","Yet still the King did not send for him, so he mounted his steed and","set off in the pride of his youth and strength to the palace. He","strode into the audience hall, where his father sat trembling, and","saluted him with all reverence; but Raja Salabhan, in fear of his","life, turned his back hastily and said never a word in reply.","","Then Prince Rasalu called scornfully to him across the hall:","","    \"I came to greet thee, King, and not to harm thee!","      What have I done that thou shouldst turn away?","    Sceptre and empire have no power to charm me--","      I go to seek a worthier prize than they!\"","","Then he strode away, full of bitterness and anger; but, as he passed","under the palace windows, he heard his mother weeping, and the sound","softened his heart, so that his wrath died down, and a great","loneliness fell upon him, because he was spurned by both father and","mother. So he cried sorrowfully,","","    \"Oh heart crown'd with grief, hast thou nought","      But tears for thy son?","    Art mother of mine?  Give one thought","      To my life just begun!\"","","And Queen Lona answered through her tears:","","    \"Yea! mother am I, though I weep,","      So hold this word sure,--","    Go, reign king of all men, but keep","      Thy heart good and pure!\"","","So Raja Rasalu was comforted, and began to make ready for fortune. He","took with him his horse Bhaunr and his parrot, both of whom had lived","with him since he was born.","","So they made a goodly company, and Queen Lona, when she saw them","going, watched them from her window till she saw nothing but a cloud","of dust on the horizon; then she bowed her head on her hands and wept,","saying:","","    \"Oh! son who ne'er gladdened mine eyes,","    Let the cloud of thy going arise,","    Dim the sunlight and darken the day;","    For the mother whose son is away","            Is as dust!\"","","Rasalu had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap. And as he","journeyed there came a fierce storm of thunder and lightning, so that","he sought shelter, and found none save an old graveyard, where a","headless corpse lay upon the ground. So lonesome was it that even the","corpse seemed company, and Rasalu, sitting down beside it, said:","","    \"There is no one here, nor far nor near,","      Save this breathless corpse so cold and grim;","    Would God he might come to life again,","      'Twould be less lonely to talk to him.\"","","And immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja Rasalu.","And he, nothing astonished, said to it:","","    \"The storm beats fierce and loud,","      The clouds rise thick in the west;","    What ails thy grave and shroud,","      Oh corpse! that thou canst not rest?\"","","Then the headless corpse replied:","","    \"On earth I was even as thou,","      My turban awry like a king,","    My head with the highest, I trow,","      Having my fun and my fling,","    Fighting my foes like a brave,","      Living my life with a swing.","            And, now I am dead,","            Sins, heavy as lead,","    Will give me no rest in my grave!\"","","So the night passed on, dark and dreary, while Rasalu sat in the","graveyard and talked to the headless corpse. Now when morning broke","and Rasalu said he must continue his journey, the headless corpse","asked him whither he was going, and when he said \"to play chaupur with","King Sarkap,\" the corpse begged him to give up the idea saying, \"I am","King Sarkap's brother, and I know his ways. Every day, before","breakfast, he cuts off the heads of two or three men, just to amuse","himself. One day no one else was at hand, so he cut off mine, and he","will surely cut off yours on some pretence or another. However, if you","are determined to go and play chaupur with him, take some of the bones","from this graveyard, and make your dice out of them, and then the","enchanted dice with which my brother plays will lose their virtue.","Otherwise he will always win.\"","","So Rasalu took some of the bones lying about, and fashioned them into","dice, and these he put into his pocket. Then, bidding adieu to the","headless corpse, he went on his way to play chaupur with the King.","","Now, as Raja Rasalu, tender-hearted and strong, journeyed along to","play chaupur with the King, he came to a burning forest, and a voice","rose from the fire saying, \"Oh, traveller! for God's sake save me from","the fire!\"","","Then the Prince turned towards the burning forest, and, lo! the voice","was the voice of a tiny cricket. Nevertheless, Rasalu, tender-hearted","and strong, snatched it from the fire and set it at liberty. Then the","little creature, full of gratitude, pulled out one of its feelers, and","giving it to its preserver, said, \"Keep this, and should you ever be","in trouble, put it into the fire, and instantly I will come to your","aid.\"","","The Prince smiled, saying, \"What help could _you_ give _me_?\"","Nevertheless, he kept the hair and went on his way.","","Now, when he reached the city of King Sarkap, seventy maidens,","daughters of the King, came out to meet him,--seventy fair maidens,","merry and careless, full of smiles and laughter; but one, the youngest","of them all, when she saw the gallant young Prince riding on Bhaunr","Iraqi, going gaily to his doom, was filled with pity, and called to","him saying:","","    \"Fair Prince, on the charger so gray,","        Turn thee back! turn thee back!","    Or lower thy lance for the fray;","    Thy head will be forfeit to-day!","    Dost love life? then, stranger, I pray,","        Turn thee back! turn thee back!\"","","But he, smiling at the maiden, answered lightly:","","    \"Fair maiden, I come from afar,","    Sworn conqueror in love and in war!","    King Sarkap my coming will rue,","    His head in four pieces I'll hew;","    Then forth as a bridegroom I'll ride,","    With you, little maid, as my bride!\"","","Now when Rasalu replied so gallantly, the maiden looked in his face,","and seeing how fair he was, and how brave and strong, she straightway","fell in love with him, and would gladly have followed him through the","world.","","But the other sixty-nine maidens, being jealous, laughed scornfully at","her, saying, \"Not so fast, oh gallant warrior! If you would marry our","sister you must first do our bidding, for you will be our younger","brother.\"","","\"Fair sisters!\" quoth Rasalu gaily, \"give me my task and I will","perform it.\"","","So the sixty-nine maidens mixed a hundred-weight of millet seed with a","hundred-weight of sand, and giving it to Rasalu, bade him separate the","seed from the sand.","","Then he bethought him of the cricket, and drawing the feeler from his","pocket, thrust it into the fire. And immediately there was a whirring","noise in the air, and a great flight of crickets alighted beside him,","and amongst them the cricket whose life he had saved.","","Then Rasalu said, \"Separate the millet seed from the sand.\"","","\"Is that all?\" quoth the cricket; \"had I known how small a job you","wanted me to do, I would not have assembled so many of my brethren.\"","","With that the flight of crickets set to work, and in one night they","separated the seed from the sand.","","Now when the sixty-nine fair maidens, daughters of the king saw that","Rasalu had performed his task, they set him another, bidding him swing","them all, one by one, in their swings, until they were tired.","","Whereupon he laughed, saying, \"There are seventy of you, counting my","little bride yonder, and I am not going to spend my life swinging","girls! Why, by the time I have given each of you a swing, the first","will be wanting another! No! if you want a swing, get in, all seventy","of you, into one swing, and then I'll see what can be done.\"","","So the seventy maidens climbed into one swing, and Raja Rasalu,","standing in his shining armour, fastened the ropes to his mighty bow,","and drew it up to its fullest bent. Then he let go, and like an arrow","the swing shot into the air, with its burden of seventy fair maidens,","merry and careless, full of smiles and laughter.","","But as it swung back again, Rasalu, standing there in his shining","armour, drew his sharp sword and severed the ropes. Then the seventy","fair maidens fell to the ground headlong; and some were bruised and","some broken, but the only one who escaped unhurt was the maiden who","loved Rasalu, for she fell out last, on the top of the others, and so","came to no harm.","","After this, Rasalu strode on fifteen paces, till he came to the","seventy drums, that every one who came to play chaupur with the King","had to beat in turn; and he beat them so loudly that he broke them","all. Then he came to the seventy gongs, all in a row, and he hammered","them so hard that they cracked to pieces.","","Seeing this, the youngest Princess, who was the only one who could","run, fled to her father the King in a great fright, saying:","","    \"A mighty Prince, Sarkap! making havoc, rides along,","    He swung us, seventy maidens fair, and threw us out headlong;","    He broke the drums you placed there and the gongs too in his pride,","    Sure, he will kill thee, father mine, and take me for his bride!\"","","But King Sarkap replied scornfully:","","    \"Silly maiden, thy words make a lot","      Of a very small matter;","    For fear of my valour, I wot,","      His armour will clatter.","    As soon as I've eaten my bread","    I'll go forth and cut off his head!\"","","Notwithstanding these brave and boastful words, he was in reality very","much afraid, having heard of Rasalu's renown. And learning that he was","stopping at the house of an old woman in the city, till the hour for","playing chaupur arrived, Sarkap sent slaves to him with trays of","sweetmeats and fruit, as to an honoured guest. But the food was","poisoned.","","Now when the slaves brought the trays to Raja Rasalu, he rose up","haughtily, saying, \"Go, tell your master I have nought to do with him","in friendship. I am his sworn enemy, and I eat not of his salt!\"","","So saying, he threw the sweetmeats to Raja Sarkap's dog, which had","followed the slave, and lo! the dog died.","","Then Rasalu was very wroth, and said bitterly, \"Go back to Sarkap,","slaves! and tell him that Rasalu deems it no act of bravery to kill","even an enemy by treachery.\"","","Now, when evening came, Raja Rasalu went forth to play chaupur with","King Sarkap, and as he passed some potters' kilns he saw a cat","wandering about restlessly; so he asked what ailed her, that she never","stood still, and she replied, \"My kittens are in an unbaked pot in the","kiln yonder. It has just been set alight, and my children will be","baked alive; therefore I cannot rest!\"","","Her words moved the heart of Raja Rasalu, and, going to the potter, he","asked him to sell the kiln as it was; but the potter replied that he","could not settle a fair price till the pots were burnt, as he could","not tell how many would come out whole. Nevertheless, after some","bargaining, he consented at last to sell the kiln, and Rasalu, having","searched all the pots, restored the kittens to their mother, and she,","in gratitude for his mercy, gave him one of them, saying, \"Put it in","your pocket, for it will help you when you are in difficulties.\" So","Raja Rasalu put the kitten in his pocket, and went to play chaupur","with the King.","","Now, before they sat down to play, Raja Sarkap fixed his stakes,--on","the first game, his kingdom; on the second, the wealth of the whole","world; and, on the third, his own head. So, likewise, Raja Rasalu","fixed his stakes,--on the first game, his arms; on the second, his","horse; and, on the third, his own head.","","Then they began to play, and it fell to Rasalu's lot to make the first","move. Now he, forgetful of the dead man's warning, played with the","dice given him by Raja Sarkap, besides which, Sarkap let loose his","famous rat, Dhol Raja, and it ran about the board, upsetting the","chaupur pieces on the sly, so that Rasalu lost the first game, and","gave up his shining armour.","","Then the second game began, and once more Dhol Raja, the rat, upset","the pieces; and Rasalu, losing the game, gave up his faithful steed.","Then Bhaunr, the Arab steed, who stood by, found voice, and cried to","his master,","","        \"Sea-born am I, bought with much gold;","        Dear Prince! trust me now as of old.","          I'll carry you far from these wiles--","    My flight, all unspurr'd, will be swift as a bird,","          For thousands and thousands of miles!","    Or if needs you must stay; ere the next game you play,","          Place hand in your pocket, I pray!\"","","Hearing this, Raja Sarkap frowned, and bade his slaves remove Bhaunr,","the Arab steed, since he gave his master advice in the game. Now, when","the slaves came to lead the faithful steed away, Rasalu could","not refrain from tears, thinking over the long years during which","Bhaunr, the Arab steed, had been his companion. But the horse cried","out again,","","    \"Weep not, dear Prince! I shall not eat my bread","    Of stranger hands, nor to strange stall be led.","    Take thy right hand, and place it as I said.\"","","[Illustration: Raja Rasalu plays chaupur with Raja Sarkap.]","","These words roused some recollection in Rasalu's mind, and when, just","at this moment, the kitten in his pocket began to struggle, he","remembered all about the warning, and the dice made from dead men's","bones. Then his heart rose up once more, and he called boldly to Raja","Sarkap, \"Leave my horse and arms here for the present. Time enough to","take them away when you have won my head!\"","","Now, Raja Sarkap, seeing Rasalu's confident bearing, began to be","afraid, and ordered all the women of his palace to come forth in their","gayest attire and stand before Rasalu, so as to distract his attention","from the game. But he never even looked at them, and drawing the dice","from his pocket, said to Sarkap, \"We have played with your dice all","this time; now we will play with mine.\"","","Then the kitten went and sat at the window through which the rat Dhol","Raja used to come, and the game began.","","After a while, Sarkap, seeing Raja Rasalu was winning, called to his","rat, but when Dhol Raja saw the kitten he was afraid, and would not go","further. So Rasalu won, and took back his arms. Next he played for his","horse, and once more Raja Sarkap called for his rat; but Dhol Raja,","seeing the kitten keeping watch, was afraid. So Rasalu won the second","stake, and took back Bhaunr, the Arab steed.","","Then Sarkap brought all his skill to bear on the third and last game,","saying,","","    \"Oh moulded pieces! favour me to-day!","    For sooth this is a man with whom I play.","    No paltry risk--but life and death at stake;","    As Sarkap does, so do, for Sarkap's sake!\"","","But Rasalu answered back,","","    \"Oh moulded pieces! favour me to-day!","    For sooth it is a man with whom I play.","    No paltry risk--but life and death at stake;","    As Heaven does, so do, for Heaven's sake!\"","","So they began to play, whilst the women stood round in a circle, and","the kitten watched Dhol Raja from the window. Then Sarkap lost, first","his kingdom, then the wealth of the whole world, and lastly his head.","","Just then, a servant came in to announce the birth of a daughter to","Raja Sarkap, and he, overcome by misfortunes, said, \"Kill her at once!","for she has been born in an evil moment, and has brought her father","ill luck!\"","","But Rasalu rose up in his shining armour, tender-hearted and strong,","saying, \"Not so, oh king! She has done no evil. Give me this child to","wife; and if you will vow, by all you hold sacred, never again to play","chaupur for another's head, I will spare yours now!\"","","Then Sarkap vowed a solemn vow never to play for another's head; and","after that he took a fresh mango branch, and the new-born babe, and","placing them on a golden dish gave them to Rasalu.","","Now, as he left the palace, carrying with him the new-born babe and","the mango branch, he met a band of prisoners, and they called out to","him,","","    \"A royal hawk art thou, oh King! the rest","    But timid wild-fowl.  Grant us our request,--","    Unloose these chains, and live for ever blest!\"","","And Raja Rasalu hearkened to them, and bade King Sarkap set them at","liberty.","","Then he went to the Murti Hills, and placed the new-born babe,","Kokilan, in an underground palace, and planted the mango branch at the","door, saying, \"In twelve years the mango tree will blossom; then will","I return and marry Kokilan.\"","","And after twelve years, the mango tree began to flower, and Raja","Rasalu married the Princess Kokilan, whom he won from Sarkap when he","played chaupur with the King.","","","","","The Ass in the Lion's Skin","","[Illustration:]","","","At the same time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the","future Buddha was born one of a peasant family; and when he grew up,","he gained his living by tilling the ground.","","At that time a hawker used to go from place to place, trafficking in","goods carried by an ass. Now at each place he came to, when he took","the pack down from the ass's back, he used to clothe him in a lion's","skin, and turn him loose in the rice and barley fields. And when the","watchmen in the fields saw the ass, they dared not go near him, taking","him for a lion.","","So one day the hawker stopped in a village; and whilst he was getting","his own breakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a lion's skin, and","turned him loose in a barley-field. The watchmen in the field dared","not go up to him; but going home, they published the news. Then all","the villagers came out with weapons in their hands; and blowing","chanks, and beating drums, they went near the field and shouted.","Terrified with the fear of death, the ass uttered a cry--the bray of","an ass!","","And when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronounced","the First Verse:","","    \"This is not a lion's roaring,","    Nor a tiger's, nor a panther's;","    Dressed in a lion's skin,","      'Tis a wretched ass that roars!\"","","But when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat him","till his bones broke; and, carrying off the lion's skin, went away.","Then the hawker came; and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight,","pronounced the Second Verse:","","    \"Long might the ass,","    Clad in a lion's skin,","    Have fed on the barley green.","    But he brayed!","      And that moment he came to ruin.\"","","And even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!","","","","","The Farmer and the Money-lender","","","There was once a farmer who suffered much at the hands of a","money-lender. Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the","money-lender rich. At the last, when he hadn't a farthing left, farmer","went to the money-lender's house, and said, \"You can't squeeze water","from a stone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tell","me the secret of becoming rich.\"","","\"My friend,\" returned the money-lender, piously, \"riches come from","Ram--ask _him_.\"","","\"Thank you, I will!\" replied the simple farmer; so he prepared three","girdle-cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.","","First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point","out the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on","his way without a word. Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to","him he gave a cake, without receiving any help in return. At last, he","came upon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was","hungry, the kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting down to","rest beside him, entered into conversation.","","\"And where are you going?\" asked the poor man, at length.","","\"Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!\"","replied the farmer. \"I don't suppose you could tell me which way to","go?\"","","\"Perhaps I can,\" said the poor man, smiling, \"for _I_ am Ram! What do","you want of me?\"","","Then the farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking pity on him,","gave him a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particular","way, saying, \"Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blow","the conch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled. Only have a care","of that money-lender, for even magic is not proof against their","wiles!\"","","The farmer went back to his village rejoicing. In fact the","money-lender noticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself,","\"Some good fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him","hold his head so jauntily.\" Therefore he went over to the simple","farmer's house, and congratulated him on his good fortune, in such","cunning words, pretending to have heard all about it, that before long","the farmer found himself telling the whole story--all except the","secret of blowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer","was not quite such a fool as to tell that.","","Nevertheless, the money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or","by crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he","waited for a favourable opportunity and stole the conch.","","But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every","conceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job.","However, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer, and","said, coolly, \"Look here; I've got your conch, but I can't use it; you","haven't got it, so it's clear you can't use it either. Business is at","a stand-still unless we make a bargain. Now, I promise to give you","back your conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on one","condition, which is this,--whatever you get from it, I am to get","double.\"","","\"Never!\" cried the farmer; \"that would be the old business all over","again!\"","","[Illustration:]","","\"Not at all!\" replied the wily money-lender; \"you will have your","share! Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for if _you_ get all you","want, what can it matter to you if _I_ am rich or poor?\"","","At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit","to a money-lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,","no matter what he gained by the power of the conch, the money-lender","gained double. And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the","farmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of","anything.","","At last, there came a very dry season,--so dry that the farmer's crops","withered for want of rain. Then he blew his conch, and wished for a","well to water them, and lo! there was the well, _but the money-lender","had two!_--two beautiful new wells! This was too much for any farmer","to stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at","last a bright idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it","loudly, and cried out, \"Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!\" And","so he was, in a twinkling, but the money-lender of course was blind of","both, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he","fell into one, and was drowned.","","Now this true story shows that a farmer once got the better of a","money-lender--but only by losing one of his eyes.","","","","","The Boy who had a Moon on his Forehead and a Star on his Chin","","","In a country were seven daughters of poor parents, who used to come","daily to play under the shady trees in the King's garden with the","gardener's daughter; and daily she used to say to them, \"When I am","married I shall have a son. Such a beautiful boy as he will be has","never been seen. He will have a moon on his forehead and a star on his","chin.\" Then her playfellows used to laugh at her and mock her.","","But one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy","she would have when she was married, and he said to himself he should","like very much to have such a son; the more so that though he had","already four Queens he had no child. He went, therefore, to the","gardener and told him he wished to marry his daughter. This delighted","the gardener and his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for","their daughter to become a princess. So they said \"Yes\" to the King,","and invited all their friends to the wedding. The King invited all","his, and he gave the gardener as much money as he wanted. Then the","wedding was held with great feasting and rejoicing.","","A year later the day drew near on which the gardener's daughter was to","have her son; and the King's four other Queens came constantly to see","her. One day they said to her, \"The King hunts every day; and the time","is soon coming when you will have your child. Suppose you fell ill","whilst he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of your","illness, what would you do then?\"","","When the King came home that evening, the gardener's daughter said to","him, \"Every day you go out hunting. Should I ever be in trouble or","sick while you are away, how could I send for you?\" The King gave her","a kettle-drum which he placed near the door for her, and he said to","her, \"Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum. No matter how far","away I may be, I shall hear it, and will come at once to you.\"","","Next morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens","came to see the gardener's daughter. She told them all about her","kettle-drum. \"Oh,\" they said, \"do drum on it just to see if the King","really will come to you.\"","","\"No, I will not,\" she said; \"for why should I call him from his","hunting when I do not want him?\"","","\"Don't mind interrupting his hunting,\" they answered. \"Do try if he","really will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum.\" So at last,","just to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her.","","\"Why have you called me?\" he said. \"See, I have left my hunting to","come to you.\"","","\"I want nothing,\" she answered; \"I only wished to know if you really","would come to me when I beat my drum.\"","","\"Very well,\" answered the King; \"but do not call me again unless you","really need me.\" Then he returned to his hunting.","","The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four","Queens again came to see the gardener's daughter. They begged and","begged her to beat her drum once more, \"just to see if the King will","really come to see you this time.\" At first she refused, but at last","she consented. So she beat her drum, and the King came to her. But","when he found she was neither ill nor in trouble, he was angry, and","said to her, \"Twice I have left my hunting and lost my game to come to","you when you did not need me. Now you may call me as much as you like,","but I will not come to you,\" and then he went away in a rage.","","The third day the gardener's daughter fell ill, and she beat and beat","her kettle-drum; but the King never came. He heard her kettle-drum,","but he thought, \"She does not really want me; she is only trying to","see if I will go to her.\"","","Meanwhile the four other Queens came to her, and they said, \"Here it","is the custom before a child is born to bind its mother's eyes with a","handkerchief that she may not see it just at first. So let us bind","your eyes.\" She answered, \"Very well, bind my eyes.\" The four wives","then tied a handkerchief over them.","","Soon after, the gardener's daughter had a beautiful little son, with a","moon on his forehead and a star on his chin, and before the poor","mother had seen him, the four wicked Queens took the boy to the nurse","and said to her, \"Now you must not let this child make the least sound","for fear his mother should hear him; and in the night you must either","kill him, or else take him away, so that his mother may never see him.","If you obey our orders, we will give you a great many rupees.\" All","this they did out of spite. The nurse took the little child and put","him into a box, and the four Queens went back to the gardener's","daughter.","","First they put a stone into her boy's little bed, and then they took","the handkerchief off her eyes and showed it her, saying, \"Look! this","is your son!\" The poor girl cried bitterly, and thought, \"What will","the King say when he finds no child?\" But she could do nothing.","","When the King came home, he was furious at hearing his youngest wife,","the gardener's daughter, had given him a stone instead of the","beautiful little son she had promised him. He made her one of the","palace servants, and never spoke to her.","","In the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the","beautiful little prince, and went out to a broad plain in the jungle.","There she dug a hole, made the fastenings of the box sure, and put the","box into the hole, although the child in it was still alive. The","King's dog, whose name was Shankar, had followed her to see what she","did with the box. As soon as she had gone back to the four Queens (who","gave her a great many rupees), the dog went to the hole in which she","had put the box, took the box out, and opened it. When he saw the","beautiful little boy, he was very much delighted and said, \"If it","pleases Khuda that this child should live, I will not hurt him; I will","not eat him, but I will swallow him whole and hide him in my stomach.\"","This he did.","","After six months had passed, the dog went by night to the jungle, and","thought, \"I wonder whether the boy is alive or dead.\" Then he brought","the child out of his stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was","now six months old. When Shankar had caressed and loved him, he","swallowed him again for another six months. At the end of that time he","went once more by night to the broad jungle-plain. There he brought up","the child out of his stomach (the child was now a year old), and","caressed and petted him a great deal, and was made very happy by his","great beauty.","","But this time the dog's keeper had followed and watched the dog; and","he saw all that Shankar did, and the beautiful little child, so he ran","to the four Queens and said to them, \"Inside the King's dog there is a","child! the loveliest child! He has a moon on his forehead and a star","on his chin. Such a child has never been seen!\" At this the four wives","were very much frightened, and as soon as the King came home from","hunting they said to him, \"While you were away your dog came to our","rooms, and tore our clothes and knocked about all our things. We are","afraid he will kill us.\" \"Do not be afraid,\" said the King. \"Eat your","dinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow morning.\"","","Then he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn, but the dog","heard him, and said to himself, \"What shall I do? The King intends to","kill me. I don't care about that, but what will become of the child if","I am killed? He will die. But I will see if I cannot save him.\"","","So when it was night, the dog ran to the King's cow, who was called","Suri, and said to her, \"Suri, I want to give you something, for the","King has ordered me to be shot to-morrow. Will you take great care of","whatever I give you?\"","","\"Let me see what it is,\" said Suri, \"I will take care of it if I","can.\" Then they both went together to the wide plain, and there the","dog brought up the boy. Suri was enchanted with him. \"I never saw such","a beautiful child in this country,\" she said. \"See, he has a moon on","his forehead and a star on his chin. I will take the greatest care of","him.\" So saying she swallowed the little prince. The dog made her a","great many salaams, and said, \"To-morrow I shall die;\" and the cow","then went back to her stable.","","Next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot.","","The child now lived in Suri's stomach; and when one whole year had","passed, and he was two years old, the cow went out to the plain, and","said to herself, \"I do not know whether the child is alive or dead.","But I have never hurt it, so I will see.\" Then she brought up the boy;","and he played about, and Suri was delighted; she loved him and","caressed him, and talked to him. Then she swallowed him, and returned","to her stable.","","At the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up","the child. He played and ran about for an hour to her great delight,","and she talked to him and caressed him. His great beauty made her very","happy. Then she swallowed him once more and returned to her stable.","The child was now three years old.","","But this time the cowherd had followed Suri, and had seen the","wonderful child and all she did to it. So he ran and told the four","Queens, \"The King's cow has a beautiful boy inside her. He has a moon","on his forehead and a star on his chin. Such a child has never been","seen before!\"","","At this the Queens were terrified. They tore their clothes and their","hair and cried. When the King came home at evening, he asked them why","they were so agitated. \"Oh,\" they said, \"your cow came and tried to","kill us; but we ran away. She tore our hair and our clothes.\" \"Never","mind,\" said the King. \"Eat your dinner and be happy. The cow shall be","killed to-morrow morning.\"","","Now Suri heard the King give this order to the servants, so she said","to herself, \"What shall I do to save the child?\" When it was midnight,","she went to the King's horse called Katar, who was very wicked, and","quite untameable. No one had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one","could go near him with safety, he was so savage. Suri said to this","horse, \"Katar, will you take care of something that I want to give","you, because the King has ordered me to be killed to-morrow?\"","","\"Good,\" said Katar; \"show me what it is.\" Then Suri brought up the","child, and the horse was delighted with him. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I will","take the greatest care of him. Till now no one has been able to ride","me, but this child shall ride me.\" Then he swallowed the boy, and when","he had done so, the cow made him many salaams, saying, \"It is for this","boy's sake that I am to die.\" The next morning she was taken to the","jungle and there killed.","","The beautiful boy now lived in the horse's stomach, and he stayed in","it for one whole year. At the end of that time the horse thought, \"I","will see if this child is alive or dead.\" So he brought him up; and","then he loved him, and petted him, and the little prince played all","about the stable, out of which the horse was never allowed to go.","Katar was very glad to see the child, who was now four years old.","After he had played for some time, the horse swallowed him again. At","the end of another year, when the boy was five years old, Katar","brought him up again, caressed him, loved him, and let him play about","the stable as he had done a year before. Then the horse swallowed him","again.","","But this time the groom had seen all that happened, and when it was","morning, and the King had gone away to his hunting, he went to the","four wicked Queens, and told them all he had seen, and all about the","wonderful, beautiful child that lived inside the King's horse Katar.","On hearing the groom's story the four Queens cried, and tore their","hair and clothes, and refused to eat. When the King returned at","evening and asked them why they were so miserable, they said, \"Your","horse Katar came and tore our clothes, and upset all our things, and","we ran away for fear he should kill us.\"","","\"Never mind,\" said the King. \"Only eat your dinner and be happy. I","will have Katar shot to-morrow.\" Then he thought that two men unaided","could not kill such a wicked horse, so he ordered his servants to bid","his troop of sepoys shoot him.","","So the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the stable, and","he took up his stand with them; and he said he would himself shoot any","one who let his horse escape.","","Meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So he brought up","the child and said to him, \"Go into that little room that leads out of","the stable, and you will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must","put on me. Then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such","as princes wear; these you must put on yourself; and you must take the","sword and gun you will find there too. Then you must mount on my","back.\" Now Katar was a fairy-horse, and came from the fairies'","country, so he could get anything he wanted; but neither the King nor","any of his people knew this. When all was ready, Katar burst out of","his stable, with the prince on his back, rushed past the King himself","before the King had time to shoot him, galloped away to the great","jungle-plain, and galloped about all over it. The King saw his horse","had a boy on his back, though he could not see the boy distinctly. The","sepoys tried in vain to shoot the horse; he galloped much too fast;","and at last they were all scattered over the plain. Then the King had","to give it up and go home; and the sepoys went to their homes. The","King could not shoot any of his sepoys for letting his horse escape,","for he himself had let him do so.","","[Illustration:]","","Then Katar galloped away, on, and on, and on; and when night came they","stayed under a tree, he and the King's son. The horse ate grass, and","the boy wild fruits which he found in the jungle. Next morning they","started afresh, and went far, and far, till they came to a jungle in","another country, which did not belong to the little prince's father,","but to another king. Here Katar said to the boy, \"Now get off my","back.\" Off jumped the prince. \"Unsaddle me and take off my bridle;","take off your beautiful clothes and tie them all up in a bundle with","your sword and gun.\" This the boy did. Then the horse gave him some","poor, common clothes, which he told him to put on. As soon as he was","dressed in them the horse said, \"Hide your bundle in this grass, and I","will take care of it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain,","so that when you want me you will always find me. You must now go away","and find service with some one in this country.\"","","This made the boy very sad. \"I know nothing about anything,\" he said.","\"What shall I do all alone in this country?\"","","\"Do not be afraid,\" answered Katar. \"You will find service, and I will","always stay here to help you when you want me. So go, only before you","go, twist my right ear.\" The boy did so, and his horse instantly","became a donkey. \"Now twist your right ear,\" said Katar. And when the","boy had twisted it, he was no longer a handsome prince, but a poor,","common-looking, ugly man; and his moon and star were hidden.","","Then he went away further into the country, until he came to a grain","merchant of the country, who asked him who he was. \"I am a poor man,\"","answered the boy, \"and I want service.\" \"Good,\" said the grain","merchant, \"you shall be my servant.\"","","Now the grain merchant lived near the King's palace, and one night at","twelve o'clock the boy was very hot; so he went out into the King's","cool garden, and began to sing a lovely song. The seventh and youngest","daughter of the King heard him, and she wondered who it was who could","sing so deliciously. Then she put on her clothes, rolled up her hair,","and came down to where the seemingly poor common man was lying","singing. \"Who are you? where do you come from?\" she asked.","","But he answered nothing.","","\"Who is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?\" thought the","little princess, and she went away. On the second night the same thing","happened, and on the third night too. But on the third night, when she","found she could not make him answer her, she said to him, \"What a","strange man you are not to answer me when I speak to you.\" But still","he remained silent, so she went away.","","The next day, when he had finished his work, the young prince went to","the jungle to see his horse, who asked him, \"Are you quite well and","happy?\" \"Yes, I am,\" answered the boy. \"I am servant to a grain","merchant. The last three nights I have gone into the King's garden and","sung a song, and each night the youngest princess has come to me and","asked me who I am, and whence I came, and I have answered nothing.","What shall I do now?\" The horse said, \"Next time she asks you who you","are, tell her you are a very poor man, and came from your own country","to find service here.\"","","The boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at night, when every","one had gone to bed, he went to the King's garden and sang his sweet","song again. The youngest princess heard him, got up, dressed, and came","to him. \"Who are you? Whence do you come?\" she asked.","","[Illustration: THE BOY WITH THE MOON ON HIS FOREHEAD]","","\"I am a very poor man,\" he answered. \"I came from my own country to","seek service here, and I am now one of the grain merchant's servants.\"","Then she went away. For three more nights the boy sang in the King's","garden, and each night the princess came and asked him the same","questions as before, and the boy gave her the same answers.","","Then she went to her father, and said to him, \"Father, I wish to be","married; but I must choose my husband myself.\" Her father consented to","this, and he wrote and invited all the Kings and Rajas in the land,","saying, \"My youngest daughter wishes to be married, but she insists on","choosing her husband herself. As I do not know who it is she wishes to","marry, I beg you will all come on a certain day, for her to see you","and make her choice.\"","","A great many Kings, Rajas, and their sons accepted this invitation and","came. When they had all arrived, the little princess's father said to","them, \"To-morrow morning you must all sit together in my garden\" (the","King's garden was very large), \"for then my youngest daughter will","come and see you all, and choose her husband. I do not know whom she","will choose.\"","","The youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the","next morning, and when the morning came, and all was ready, she","dressed herself in the most lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful","jewels; then she mounted her elephant, which was painted blue. In her","hand she took a gold necklace.","","Then she went into the garden where the Kings, Rajas, and their sons","were seated. The boy, the grain merchant's servant, was also in the","garden: not as a suitor, but looking on with the other servants.","","The princess rode all round the garden, and looked at all the Kings","and Rajas and princes, and then she hung the gold necklace round the","neck of the boy, the grain merchant's servant. At this everybody","laughed, and the Kings were greatly astonished. But then they and the","Rajas said, \"What fooling is this?\" and they pushed the pretended poor","man away, and took the necklace off his neck, and said to him, \"Get","out of the way, you poor, dirty man. Your clothes are far too dirty","for you to come near us!\" The boy went far away from them, and stood a","long way off to see what would happen.","","Then the King's youngest daughter went all round the garden again,","holding her gold necklace in her hand, and once more she hung it round","the boy's neck. Every one laughed at her and said, \"How can the King's","daughter think of marrying this poor, common man!\" and the Kings and","the Rajas, who had come as suitors, all wanted to turn him out of the","garden. But the princess said, \"Take care! take care! You must not","turn him out. Leave him alone.\" Then she put him on her elephant, and","took him to the palace.","","The Kings and Rajas and their sons were very much astonished, and","said, \"What does this mean? The princess does not care to marry one of","us, but chooses that very poor man!\" Her father then stood up, and","said to them all, \"I promised my daughter she should marry any one she","pleased, and as she has twice chosen that poor, common man, she shall","marry him.\" And so the princess and the boy were married with great","pomp and splendour: her father and mother were quite content with her","choice; and the Kings, the Rajas and their sons, all returned to their","homes.","","Now the princess's six sisters had all married rich princes, and they","laughed at her for choosing such a poor ugly husband as hers seemed to","be, and said to each other, mockingly, \"See! our sister has married","this poor, common man!\" Their six husbands used to go out hunting","every day, and every evening they brought home quantities of all kinds","of game to their wives, and the game was cooked for their dinner and","for the King's; but the husband of the youngest princess always stayed","at home in the palace, and never went out hunting at all. This made","her very sad, and she said to herself, \"My sisters' husbands hunt","every day, but my husband never hunts at all.\"","","At last she said to him, \"Why do you never go out hunting as my","sisters' husbands do every day, and every day they bring home","quantities of all kinds of game? Why do you always stay at home,","instead of doing as they do?\"","","One day he said to her, \"I am going out to-day to eat the air.\"","","\"Very good,\" she answered; \"go, and take one of the horses.\"","","\"No,\" said the young prince, \"I will not ride, I will walk.\" Then he","went to the jungle-plain where he had left Katar, who all this time","had seemed to be a donkey, and he told Katar everything. \"Listen,\" he","said; \"I have married the youngest princess; and when we were married","everybody laughed at her for choosing me, and said, 'What a very poor,","common man our princess has chosen for her husband!' Besides, my wife","is very sad, for her six sisters' husbands all hunt every day, and","bring home quantities of game, and their wives therefore are very","proud of them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt. To-day I","should like to hunt very much.\"","","\"Well,\" said Katar, \"then twist my left ear;\" and as soon as the boy","had twisted it, Katar was a horse again, and not a donkey any longer.","\"Now,\" said Katar, \"twist your left ear, and you will see what a","beautiful young prince you will become.\" So the boy twisted his own","left ear, and there he stood no longer a poor, common, ugly man, but a","grand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.","Then he put on his splendid clothes, saddled and bridled Katar, got on","his back with his sword and gun, and rode off to hunt.","","He rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer.","That day his six brothers-in-law could find no game, for the beautiful","young prince had shot it all. Nearly all the day long these six","princes wandered about looking in vain for game; till at last they","grew hungry and thirsty, and could find no water, and they had no food","with them. Meanwhile the beautiful young prince had sat down under a","tree, to dine and rest, and there his six brothers-in-law found him.","By his side was some delicious water, and also some roast meat.","","When they saw him the six princes said to each other, \"Look at that","handsome prince. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.","We have never seen such a prince in this jungle before; he must come","from another country.\" Then they came up to him, and made him many","salaams, and begged him to give them some food and water. \"Who are","you?\" said the young prince. \"We are the husbands of the six elder","daughters of the King of this country,\" they answered; \"and we have","hunted all day, and are very hungry and thirsty.\" They did not","recognise their brother-in-law in the least.","","\"Well,\" said the young prince, \"I will give you something to eat and","drink if you will do as I bid you.\" \"We will do all you tell us to","do,\" they answered, \"for if we do not get water to drink, we shall","die.\" \"Very good,\" said the young prince. \"Now you must let me put a","red-hot pice on the back of each of you, and then I will give you food","and water. Do you agree to this?\" The six princes consented, for they","thought, \"No one will ever see the mark of the pice, as it will be","covered by our clothes; and we shall die if we have no water to","drink.\" Then the young prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in","the fire; he laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave","them good food and water. They ate and drank; and when they had","finished they made him many salaams and went home.","","The young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening; then he","mounted his horse and rode off to the King's palace. All the people","looked at him as he came riding along, saying, \"What a splendid young","prince that is! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\"","But no one recognised him. When he came near the King's palace, all","the King's servants asked him who he was; and as none of them knew","him, the gate-keepers would not let him pass in. They all wondered who","he could be, and all thought him the most beautiful prince that had","ever been seen.","","At last they asked him who he was. \"I am the husband of your youngest","princess,\" he answered.","","\"No, no, indeed you are not,\" they said; \"for he is a poor,","common-looking, and ugly man.\"","","\"But I am he,\" answered the prince; only no one would believe him.","","\"Tell us the truth,\" said the servants; \"who are you?\"","","\"Perhaps you cannot recognise me,\" said the young prince, \"but call","the youngest princess here. I wish to speak to her.\" The servants","called her, and she came. \"That man is not my husband,\" she said at","once. \"My husband is not nearly as handsome as that man. This must be","a prince from another country.\"","","Then she said to him, \"Who are you? Why do you say you are my","husband?\"","","\"Because I am your husband. I am telling you the truth,\" answered the","young prince.","","\"No you are not, you are not telling me the truth,\" said the little","princess. \"My husband is not a handsome man like you. I married a very","poor, common-looking man.\"","","\"That is true,\" he answered, \"but nevertheless I am your husband. I","was the grain merchant's servant; and one hot night I went into your","father's garden and sang, and you heard me, and came and asked me who","I was and where I came from, and I would not answer you. And the same","thing happened the next night, and the next, and on the fourth I told","you I was a very poor man, and had come from my country to seek","service in yours, and that I was the grain merchant's servant. Then","you told your father you wished to marry, but must choose your own","husband; and when all the Kings and Rajas were seated in your father's","garden, you sat on an elephant and went round and looked at them all;","and then twice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and chose me.","See, here is your necklace, and here are the ring and the handkerchief","you gave me on our wedding day.\"","","Then she believed him, and was very glad that her husband was such a","beautiful young prince. \"What a strange man you are!\" she said to","him. \"Till now you have been poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now","you are beautiful and look like a prince; I never saw such a handsome","man as you are before; and yet I know you must be my husband.\" Then","she worshipped God and thanked him for letting her have such a","husband. \"I have,\" she said, \"a beautiful husband. There is no one","like him in this country. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on","his chin.\" Then she took him into the palace, and showed him to her","father and mother and to every one. They all said they had never seen","any one like him, and were all very happy. And the young prince lived","as before in the King's palace with his wife, and Katar lived in the","King's stables.","","One day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were in his","court-house, and it was full of people, the young prince said to him,","\"There are six thieves here in your court-house.\" \"Six thieves!\" said","the King. \"Where are they? Show them to me.\" \"There they are,\" said","the young prince, pointing to his six brothers-in-law. The King and","every one else in the court-house were very much astonished, and would","not believe the young prince. \"Take off their coats,\" he said, \"and","then you will see for yourselves that each of them has the mark of a","thief on his back.\" So their coats were taken off the six princes, and","the King and everybody in the court-house saw the mark of the red-hot","pice. The six princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince was","very glad. He had not forgotten how his brothers-in-law had laughed at","him and mocked him when he seemed a poor, common man.","","Now, when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince was","married, he had told the boy the whole story of his birth, and all","that had happened to him and his mother. \"When you are married,\" he","said to him, \"I will take you back to your father's country.\" So two","months after the young prince had revenged himself on his","brothers-in-law, Katar said to him, \"It is time for you to return to","your father. Get the King to let you go to your own country, and I","will tell you what to do when we get there.\"","","The prince always did what his horse told him to do; so he went to his","wife and said to her, \"I wish very much to go to my own country to see","my father and mother.\" \"Very well,\" said his wife; \"I will tell my","father and mother, and ask them to let us go.\" Then she went to them,","and told them, and they consented to let her and her husband leave","them. The King gave his daughter and the young prince a great many","horses, and elephants, and all sorts of presents, and also a great","many sepoys to guard them. In this grand state they travelled to the","prince's country, which was not a great many miles off. When they","reached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the","prince had been left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Suri","had swallowed him so often.","","When the King, his father, the gardener's daughter's husband, saw the","prince's camp, he was very much alarmed, and thought a great King had","come to make war on him. He sent one of his servants, therefore, to","ask whose camp it was. The young prince then wrote him a letter, in","which he said, \"You are a great King. Do not fear me. I am not come to","make war on you. I am as if I were your son. I am a prince who has","come to see your country and to speak with you. I wish to give you a","grand feast, to which every one in your country must come--men and","women, old and young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children,","fakirs, and sepoys. You must bring them all here to me for a week, and","I will feast them all.\"","","The King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all the men,","women, and children of all castes, fakirs, and sepoys, in his country","to go to the prince's camp to a grand feast the prince would give","them. So they all came, and the King brought his four wives too. All","came, at least all but the gardener's daughter. No one had told her to","go to the feast, for no one had thought of her.","","When all the people were assembled, the prince saw his mother was not","there, and he asked the King, \"Has every one in your country come to","my feast?\"","","\"Yes, every one,\" said the King.","","\"Are you sure of that?\" asked the prince.","","\"Quite sure,\" answered the King.","","\"I am sure one woman has not come,\" said the prince. \"She is your","gardener's daughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in","your palace.\"","","\"True,\" said the King, \"I had forgotten her.\" Then the prince told his","servants to take his finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener's","daughter. They were to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and","handsome jewels, and then bring her to him in the palanquin.","","While the servants were bringing the gardener's daughter, the King","thought how handsome the young prince was; and he noticed particularly","the moon on his forehead and the star on his chin, and he wondered in","what country the young prince was born.","","And now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener's daughter, and","the young prince went himself and took her out of it, and brought her","into the tent. He made her a great many salaams. The four wicked wives","looked on and were very much surprised and very angry. They remembered","that, when they arrived, the prince had made them no salaams, and","since then had not taken the least notice of them; whereas he could","not do enough for the gardener's daughter, and seemed very glad to see","her.","","When they were all at dinner, the prince again made the gardener's","daughter a great many salaams, and gave her food from all the nicest","dishes. She wondered at his kindness to her, and thought, \"Who is this","handsome prince, with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin? I","never saw any one so beautiful. What country does he come from?\"","","Two or three days were thus passed in feasting, and all that time the","King and his people were talking about the prince's beauty, and","wondering who he was.","","One day the prince asked the King if he had any children. \"None,\" he","answered.","","\"Do you know who I am?\" asked the prince.","","\"No,\" said the King. \"Tell me who you are.\"","","\"I am your son,\" answered the prince, \"and the gardener's daughter is","my mother.\"","","The King shook his head sadly. \"How can you be my son,\" he said, \"when","I have never had any children?\"","","\"But I am your son,\" answered the prince. \"Your four wicked Queens","told you the gardener's daughter had given you a stone and not a son;","but it was they who put the stone in my little bed, and then they","tried to kill me.\"","","The King did not believe him. \"I wish you were my son,\" he said; \"but","as I never had a child, you cannot be my son.\" \"Do you remember your","dog Shankar, and how you had him killed? And do you remember your cow","Suri, and how you had her killed too? Your wives made you kill them","because of me. And,\" he said, taking the King to Katar, \"do you know","whose horse that is?\"","","The King looked at Katar, and then said, \"That is my horse Katar.\"","\"Yes,\" said the prince. \"Do you not remember how he rushed past you","out of his stable with me on his back?\" Then Katar told the King the","prince was really his son, and told him all the story of his birth,","and of his life up to that moment; and when the King found the","beautiful prince was indeed his son, he was so glad, so glad. He put","his arms round him and kissed him and cried for joy.","","\"Now,\" said the King, \"you must come with me to my palace, and live","with me always.\"","","\"No,\" said the prince, \"that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace.","I only came here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I","will take her with me to my father-in-law's palace. I have married a","King's daughter, and we live with her father.\"","","\"But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go,\" said his father.","\"You and your wife must come and live with your mother and me in my","palace.\"","","\"That we will never do,\" said the prince, \"unless you will kill your","four wicked Queens with your own hand. If you will do that, we will","come and live with you.\"","","So the King killed his Queens, and then he and his wife, the","gardener's daughter, and the prince and his wife, all went to live in","the King's palace, and lived there happily together for ever after;","and the King thanked God for giving him such a beautiful son, and for","ridding him of his four wicked wives.","","Katar did not return to the fairies' country, but stayed always with","the young prince, and never left him.","","","","","The Prince and the Fakir","","","There was once upon a time a King who had no children. Now this King","went and laid him down to rest at a place where four roads met, so","that every one who passed had to step over him.","","At last a Fakir came along, and he said to the King, \"Man, why are you","lying here?\"","","He replied, \"Fakir, a thousand men have come and passed by; you pass","on too.\"","","But the Fakir said, \"Who are you, man?\"","","The King replied, \"I am a King, Fakir. Of goods and gold I have no","lack, but I have lived long and have no children. So I have come here,","and have laid me down at the cross-roads. My sins and offences have","been very many, so I have come and am lying here that men may pass","over me, and perchance my sins may be forgiven me, and God may be","merciful, and I may have a son.\"","","The Fakir answered him, \"Oh King! If you have children, what will you","give me?\"","","\"Whatever you ask, Fakir,\" answered the King.","","The Fakir said, \"Of goods and gold I have no lack, but I will say a","prayer for you, and you will have two sons; one of those sons will be","mine.\"","","[Illustration:]","","Then he took out two sweetmeats and handed them to the King, and said,","\"King! take these two sweetmeats and give them to your wives; give","them to the wives you love best.\"","","The King took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom.","","Then the Fakir said, \"King! in a year I will return, and of the two","sons who will be born to you one is mine and one yours.\"","","The King said, \"Well, I agree.\"","","Then the Fakir went on his way, and the King came home and gave one","sweetmeat to each of his two wives. After some time two sons were born","to the King. Then what did the King do but place those two sons in an","underground room, which he had built in the earth.","","Some time passed, and one day the Fakir appeared, and said, \"King!","bring me that son of yours!\"","","What did the King do but bring two slave-girls' sons and present them","to the Fakir. While the Fakir was sitting there the King's sons were","sitting down below in their cellar eating their food. Just then a","hungry ant had carried away a grain of rice from their food, and was","going along with it to her children. Another stronger ant came up and","attacked her in order to get this grain of rice. The first ant said,","\"O ant, why do you drag this away from me? I have long been lame in my","feet, and I have got just one grain, and am carrying it to my","children. The King's sons are sitting in the cellar eating their food;","you go and fetch a grain from there; why should you take mine from","me?\" On this the second ant let go and did not rob the first, but went","off to where the King's sons were eating their food.","","On hearing this the Fakir said, \"King! these are not your sons; go and","bring those children who are eating their food in the cellar.\"","","Then the King went and brought his own sons. The Fakir chose the","eldest son and took him away, and set off with him on his journey.","When he got home he told the King's son to go out to gather fuel.","","So the King's son went out to gather cow-dung, and when he had","collected some he brought it in.","","Then the Fakir looked at the King's son and put on a great pot, and","said, \"Come round here, my pupil.\"","","But the King's son said, \"Master first, and pupil after.\"","","The Fakir told him to come once, he told him twice, he told him three","times, and each time the King's son answered, \"Master first, and pupil","after.\"","","Then the Fakir made a dash at the King's son, thinking to catch him","and throw him into the caldron. There were about a hundred gallons of","oil in this caldron, and the fire was burning beneath it. Then the","King's son, lifting the Fakir, gave him a jerk and threw him into the","caldron, and he was burnt, and became roast meat. He then saw a key of","the Fakir's lying there; he took this key and opened the door of the","Fakir's house. Now many men were locked up in this house; two horses","were standing there in a hut of the Fakir's; two greyhounds were tied","up there; two simurgs were imprisoned, and two tigers also stood","there. So the King's son let all the creatures go, and took them out","of the house, and they all returned thanks to God. Next he let out all","the men who were in prison. He took away with him the two horses, and","he took away the two tigers, and he took away the two hounds, and he","took away the two simurgs, and with them he set out for another","country.","","As he went along the road he saw above him a bald man, grazing a herd","of calves, and this bald man called out to him, \"Fellow! can you fight","at all?\"","","The King's son replied, \"When I was little I could fight a bit, and","now, if any one wants to fight, I am not so unmanly as to turn my","back. Come, I will fight you.\"","","The bald man said, \"If I throw you, you shall be my slave; and if you","throw me, I will be your slave.\" So they got ready and began to fight,","and the King's son threw him.","","On this the King's son said, \"I will leave my beasts here, my simurgs,","tigers, and dogs, and horses; they will all stay here while I go to","the city to see the sights. I appoint the tiger as guard over my","property. And you are my slave, you, too, must stay here with my","belongings.\" So the King's son started off to the city to see the","sights, and arrived at a pool.","","He saw that it was a pleasant pool, and thought he would stop and","bathe there, and therewith he began to strip off his clothes.","","Now the King's daughter, who was sitting on the roof of the palace,","saw his royal marks, and she said, \"This man is a king; when I marry,","I will marry him and no other.\" So she said to her father, \"My father;","I wish to marry.\"","","\"Good,\" said her father.","","Then the King made a proclamation: \"Let all men, great and small,","attend to-day in the hall of audience, for the King's daughter will","to-day take a husband.\"","","All the men of the land assembled, and the traveller Prince also came,","dressed in the Fakir's clothes, saying to himself, \"I must see this","ceremony to-day.\" He went in and sat down.","","The King's daughter came out and sat in the balcony, and cast her","glance round all the assembly. She noticed that the traveller Prince","was sitting in the assembly in Fakir's attire.","","The Princess said to her handmaiden, \"Take this dish of henna, go to","that traveller dressed like a Fakir, and sprinkle scent on him from","the dish.\"","","The handmaiden obeyed the Princess's order, went to him, and sprinkled","the scent over him.","","Then the people said, \"The slave-girl has made a mistake.\"","","But she replied, \"The slave-girl has made no mistake, 'tis her","mistress has made the mistake.\"","","On this the King married his daughter to the Fakir, who was really no","Fakir, but a Prince.","","What fate had decreed came to pass in that country, and they were","married. But the King of that city became very sad in his heart,","because when so many chiefs and nobles were sitting there his daughter","had chosen none of them, but had chosen that Fakir; but he kept these","thoughts concealed in his heart.","","One day the traveller Prince said, \"Let all the King's sons-in-law","come out with me to-day to hunt.\"","","People said, \"What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting?\"","","However, they all set out for the hunt, and fixed their meeting-place","at a certain pool.","","The newly married Prince went to his tigers, and told his tigers and","hounds to kill and bring in a great number of gazelles and hog-deer","and markhor. Instantly they killed and brought in a great number. Then","taking with him these spoils of the chase, the Prince came to the pool","settled on as a meeting-place. The other Princes, sons-in-law of the","King of that city, also assembled there; but they had brought in no","game, and the new Prince had brought a great deal. Thence they","returned home to the town, and went to the King their father-in-law,","to present their game.","","Now that King had no son. Then the new Prince told him that in fact","he, too, was a Prince. At this the King, his father-in-law, was","greatly delighted and took him by the hand and embraced him. He seated","him by himself, saying, \"O Prince, I return thanks that you have come","here and become my son-in-law; I am very happy at this, and I make","over my kingdom to you.\"","","","","","Why the Fish Laughed.","","[Illustration:]","","","As a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queen","appeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and show","what she had. At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the","bottom of the basket.","","\"Is it a he or a she?\" inquired the queen. \"I wish to purchase a she","fish.\"","","On hearing this the fish laughed aloud.","","\"It's a he,\" replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.","","The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to see","her in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her.","","\"Are you indisposed?\" he said.","","\"No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behaviour of a fish. A","woman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a male","or female, the fish laughed most rudely.\"","","\"A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming.\"","","\"I am not a fool. I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and","have heard with my own ears.\"","","\"Passing strange! Be it so. I will inquire concerning it.\"","","On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had told","him, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with a","satisfactory answer within six months, on pain of death. The vizier","promised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure. For","five months he laboured indefatigably to find a reason for the","laughter of the fish. He sought everywhere and from every one. The","wise and learned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner","of trickery, were consulted. Nobody, however, could explain the","matter; and so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to","arrange his affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had","sufficient experience of the king to know that His Majesty would not","go back from his threat. Amongst other things, he advised his son to","travel for a time, until the king's anger should have somewhat cooled.","","The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started off","whithersoever Kismat might lead him. He had been gone some days, when","he fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certain","village. Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he might","accompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place. The old","farmer agreed, and they walked along together. The day was hot, and","the way was long and weary.","","\"Don't you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave","one another a lift?\" said the youth.","","\"What a fool the man is!\" thought the old farmer.","","Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle,","and looking like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze.","","\"Is this eaten or not?\" said the young man.","","Not understanding his meaning, the old man replied, \"I don't know.\"","","After a little while the two travellers arrived at a big village,","where the young man gave his companion a clasp-knife, and said, \"Take","this, friend, and get two horses with it; but mind and bring it back,","for it is very precious.\"","","The old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the","knife, muttering something to the effect that his friend was either a","fool himself or else trying to play the fool with him. The young man","pretended not to notice his reply, and remained almost silent till","they reached the city, a short distance outside which was the old","farmer's house. They walked about the bazaar and went to the mosque,","but nobody saluted them or invited them to come in and rest.","","\"What a large cemetery!\" exclaimed the young man.","","\"What does the man mean,\" thought the old farmer, \"calling this","largely populated city a cemetery?\"","","On leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few","people were praying beside a grave and distributing chapatis and","kulchas to passers-by, in the name of their beloved dead. They","beckoned to the two travellers and gave them as much as they would.","","\"What a splendid city this is!\" said the young man.","","\"Now, the man must surely be demented!\" thought the old farmer. \"I","wonder what he will do next? He will be calling the land water, and","the water land; and be speaking of light where there is darkness, and","of darkness when it is light.\" However, he kept his thoughts to","himself.","","Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of","the cemetery. The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took off","his shoes and paijamas and crossed over; but the young man waded","through it with his shoes and paijamas on.","","\"Well! I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed,\"","said the old man to himself.","","However, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his","wife and daughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as","long as he had occasion to remain in the village.","","\"Thank you very much,\" the young man replied; \"but let me first","inquire, if you please, whether the beam of your house is strong.\"","","The old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing.","","\"There is a man in yonder field,\" he said, after returning their","greetings. \"He has come the greater part of the way with me, and I","wanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village.","But the fellow is such a fool that I cannot make anything out of him.","He wants to know if the beam of this house is all right. The man must","be mad!\" and saying this, he burst into a fit of laughter.","","\"Father,\" said the farmer's daughter, who was a very sharp and wise","girl, \"this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him. He only","wishes to know if you can afford to entertain him.\"","","\"Oh! of course,\" replied the farmer. \"I see. Well perhaps you can help","me to solve some of his other mysteries. While we were walking","together he asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him, as","he thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding.\"","","\"Most assuredly,\" said the girl. \"He meant that one of you should tell","a story to beguile the time.\"","","\"Oh yes. Well, we were passing through a corn-field, when he asked me","whether it was eaten or not.\"","","\"And didn't you know the meaning of this, father? He simply wished to","know if the man was in debt or not; because, if the owner of the field","was in debt, then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to","him; that is, it would have to go to his creditors.\"","","\"Yes, yes, yes; of course! Then, on entering a certain village, he","bade me take his clasp knife and get two horses with it, and bring","back the knife again to him.\"","","\"Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one along","on the road? He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and be","careful not to lose his knife.\"","","\"I see,\" said the farmer. \"While we were walking over the city we did","not see anybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap of","anything to eat, till we were passing the cemetery; but there some","people called to us and put into our hands some chapatis and kulchas;","so my companion called the city a cemetery, and the cemetery a city.\"","","\"This also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city as","the place where everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitable","people as worse than the dead. The city, though crowded with people,","was as if dead, as far as you were concerned; while, in the cemetery,","which is crowded with the dead, you were saluted by kind friends and","provided with bread.\"","","\"True, true!\" said the astonished farmer. \"Then, just now, when we","were crossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off his","shoes and paijamas.\"","","\"I admire his wisdom,\" replied the girl. \"I have often thought how","stupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and","over those sharp stones with bare feet. The slightest stumble and they","would fall, and be wetted from head to foot. This friend of yours is a","most wise man. I should like to see him and speak to him.\"","","\"Very well,\" said the farmer; \"I will go and find him, and bring him","in.\"","","\"Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he will","come in. I'll send on ahead a present to the man, to show him that we","can afford to have him for our guest.\"","","Accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with a","present of a basin of ghee, twelve chapatis, and a jar of milk, and","the following message:--\"O friend, the moon is full; twelve months","make a year, and the sea is overflowing with water.\"","","Half-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son,","who, seeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him some","of the food. His father foolishly complied. Presently he saw the young","man, and gave him the rest of the present and the message.","","\"Give your mistress my salam,\" he replied, \"and tell her that the moon","is new, and that I can only find eleven months in the year, and the","sea is by no means full.\"","","Not understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated","them word for word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus","his theft was discovered, and he was severely punished. After a little","while the young man appeared with the old farmer. Great attention was","shown to him, and he was treated in every way as if he were the son of","a great man, although his humble host knew nothing of his origin. At","length he told them everything--about the laughing of the fish, his","father's threatened execution, and his own banishment--and asked their","advice as to what he should do.","","\"The laughing of the fish,\" said the girl, \"which seems to have been","the cause of all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in the","palace who is plotting against the king's life.\"","","\"Joy, joy!\" exclaimed the vizier's son. \"There is yet time for me to","return and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and","the king from danger.\"","","The following day he hastened back to his own country, taking with him","the farmer's daughter. Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and","informed his father of what he had heard. The poor vizier, now almost","dead from the expectation of death, was at once carried to the king,","to whom he repeated the news that his son had just brought.","","\"Never!\" said the king.","","\"But it must be so, Your Majesty,\" replied the vizier; \"and in order","to prove the truth of what I have heard, I pray you to call together","all the maids in your palace, and order them to jump over a pit,","which must be dug. We'll soon find out whether there is any man","there.\"","","[Illustration:]","","The king had the pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to the","palace to try to jump it. All of them tried, but only one succeeded.","That one was found to be a man!!","","Thus was the queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.","","Afterwards, as soon as could be, the vizier's son married the old","farmer's daughter; and a most happy marriage it was.","","","","","The Demon with the Matted Hair","","","_This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a Brother who had","ceased striving after righteousness. Said the Teacher to him: \"Is it","really true that you have ceased all striving?\"--\"Yes, Blessed One,\"","he replied. Then the Teacher said: \"O Brother, in former days wise men","made effort in the place where effort should be made, and so attained","unto royal power.\" And he told a story of long ago._","","","Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was King of Benares, the","Bodhisatta was born as son of his chief queen. On his name-day they","asked 800 Brahmans, having satisfied them with all their desires,","about his lucky marks. The Brahmans who had skill in divining from","such marks beheld the excellence of his, and made answer:","","\"Full of goodness, great King, is your son, and when you die he will","become king; he shall be famous and renowned for his skill with the","five weapons, and shall be the chief man in all India.\" On hearing","what the Brahmans had to say, they gave him the name of the Prince of","the Five Weapons, sword, spear, bow, battle-axe, and shield.","","When he came to years of discretion, and had attained the measure of","sixteen years, the King said to him:","","\"My son, go and complete your education.\"","","\"Who shall be my teacher?\" the lad asked.","","\"Go, my son; in the kingdom of Candahar, in the city of Takkasila, is","a far-famed teacher from whom I wish you to learn. Take this, and give","it him for a fee.\" With that he gave him a thousand pieces of money,","and dismissed him.","","The lad departed, and was educated by this teacher; he received the","Five Weapons from him as a gift, bade him farewell, and leaving","Takkasila, he began his journey to Benares, armed with the Five","Weapons.","","On his way he came to a forest inhabited by the Demon with the Matted","Hair. At the entering in of the forest some men saw him, and cried","out:","","\"Hullo, young sir, keep clear of that wood! There's a Demon in it","called he of the Matted Hair: he kills every man he sees!\" And they","tried to stop him. But the Bodhisatta, having confidence in himself,","went straight on, fearless as a maned lion.","","When he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself. He made himself","as tall as a palm tree; his head was the size of a pagoda, his eyes as","big as saucers, and he had two tusks all over knobs and bulbs; he had","the face of a hawk, a variegated belly, and blue hands and feet.","","\"Where are you going?\" he shouted. \"Stop! You'll make a meal for me!\"","","Said the Bodhisatta: \"Demon, I came here trusting in myself. I advise","you to be careful how you come near me. Here's a poisoned arrow, which","I'll shoot at you and knock you down!\" With this menace, he fitted to","his bow an arrow dipped in deadly poison, and let fly. The arrow stuck","fast in the Demon's hair. Then he shot and shot, till he had shot away","fifty arrows; and they all stuck in the Demon's hair. The Demon","snapped them all off short, and threw them down at his feet; then came","up to the Bodhisatta, who drew his sword and struck the Demon,","threatening him the while. His sword--it was three-and-thirty inches","long--stuck in the Demon's hair! The Bodhisatta struck him with his","spear--that stuck too! He struck him with his club--and that stuck","too!","","When the Bodhisatta saw that this had stuck fast, he addressed the","Demon. \"You, Demon!\" said he, \"did you never hear of me before--the","Prince of the Five Weapons? When I came into the forest which you live","in I did not trust to my bow and other weapons. This day will I pound","you and grind you to powder!\" Thus did he declare his resolve, and","with a shout he hit at the Demon with his right hand. It stuck fast in","his hair! He hit him with his left hand--that stuck too! With his","right foot he kicked him--that stuck too; then with his left--and that","stuck too! Then he butted at him with his head, crying, \"I'll pound","you to powder!\" and his head stuck fast like the rest.","","Thus the Bodhisatta was five times snared, caught fast in five places,","hanging suspended: yet he felt no fear--was not even nervous.","","[Illustration: THE DEMON WITH THE MATTED HAIR]","","Thought the Demon to himself: \"Here's a lion of a man! A","noble man! More than man is he! Here he is, caught by a Demon like me;","yet he will not fear a bit. Since I have ravaged this road, I never","saw such a man. Now, why is it that he does not fear?\" He was","powerless to eat the man, but asked him: \"Why is it, young sir, that","you are not frightened to death?\"","","\"Why should I fear, Demon?\" replied he. \"In one life a man can die but","once. Besides, in my belly is a thunderbolt; if you eat me, you will","never be able to digest it; this will tear your inwards into little","bits, and kill you: so we shall both perish. That is why I fear","nothing.\" (By this, the Bodhisatta meant the weapon of knowledge which","he had within him.)","","When he heard this, the Demon thought: \"This young man speaks the","truth. A piece of the flesh of such a lion-man as he would be too much","for me to digest, if it were no bigger than a kidney-bean. I'll let","him go!\" So, being frightened to death, he let go the Bodhisatta,","saying:","","\"Young sir, you are a lion of a man! I will not eat you up. I set you","free from my hands, as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rāhu","after the eclipse. Go back to the company of your friends and","relations!\"","","And the Bodhisatta said: \"Demon, I will go, as you say. You were born","a Demon, cruel, blood-bibbing, devourer of the flesh and gore of","others, because you did wickedly in former lives. If you still go on","doing wickedly, you will go from darkness to darkness. But now that","you have seen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly. Taking","the life of living creatures causes birth, as an animal, in the world","of Petas, or in the body of an Asura, or, if one is reborn as a man,","it makes his life short.\" With this and the like monition he told him","the disadvantage of the five kinds of wickedness, and the profit of","the five kinds of virtue, and frightened the Demon in various ways,","discoursing to him until he subdued him and made him self-denying, and","established him in the five kinds of virtue; he made him worship the","deity to whom offerings were made in that wood; and having carefully","admonished him, departed out of it.","","At the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout;","and went on to Benares, armed with his five weapons. Afterwards he","became king, and ruled righteously; and after giving alms and doing","good he passed away according to his deeds.","","       *       *       *       *       *","","_And the Teacher, when this tale was ended, became perfectly","enlightened, and repeated this verse_:","","    _Whose mind and heart from all desire is free,","    Who seeks for peace by living virtuously,","      He in due time will sever all the bonds","    That bind him fast to life, and cease to be._","","_Thus the Teacher reached the summit, through sainthood and the","teaching of the law, and thereupon he declared the Four Truths. At the","end of the declaring of the Truths, this Brother also attained to","sainthood. Then the Teacher made the connexion, and gave the key to","the birth-tale, saying: \"At that time Angulimala was the Demon, but","the Prince of the Five Weapons was I myself.\"_","","","","","The Ivory City and its Fairy Princess","","[Illustration:]","","","One day a young prince was out practising archery with the son of his","father's chief vizier, when one of the arrows accidentally struck the","wife of a merchant, who was walking about in an upper room of a house","close by. The prince aimed at a bird that was perched on the","window-sill of that room, and had not the slightest idea that anybody","was at hand, or he would not have shot in that direction.","Consequently, not knowing what had happened, he and the vizier's son","walked away, the vizier's son chaffing him because he had missed the","bird.","","Presently the merchant went to ask his wife about something, and found","her lying, to all appearance, dead in the middle of the room, and an","arrow fixed in the ground within half a yard of her head. Supposing","that she was dead, he rushed to the window and shrieked, \"Thieves","thieves! They have killed my wife.\" The neighbours quickly gathered,","and the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter. It","happened that the woman had fainted, and that there was only a very","slight wound in her breast where the arrow had grazed.","","As soon as the woman recovered her senses she told them that two young","men had passed by the place with their bows and arrows, and that one","of them had most deliberately aimed at her as she stood by the window.","","On hearing this the merchant went to the king, and told him what had","taken place. His Majesty was much enraged at such audacious","wickedness, and swore that most terrible punishment should be visited","on the offender if he could be discovered. He ordered the merchant to","go back and ascertain whether his wife could recognise the young men","if she saw them again.","","\"Oh yes,\" replied the woman, \"I should know them again among all the","people in the city.\"","","\"Then,\" said the king, when the merchant brought back this reply,","\"to-morrow I will cause all the male inhabitants of this city to pass","before your house, and your wife will stand at the window and watch","for the man who did this wanton deed.\"","","A royal proclamation was issued to this effect. So the next day all","the men and boys of the city, from the age of ten years upwards,","assembled and marched by the house of the merchant. By chance (for","they both had been excused from obeying this order) the king's son and","the vizier's son were also in the company, and passed by in the crowd.","They came to see the tamasha.","","As soon as these two appeared in front of the merchant's window they","were recognised by the merchant's wife, and at once reported to the","king.","","\"My own son and the son of my chief vizier!\" exclaimed the king, who","had been present from the commencement. \"What examples for the people!","Let them both be executed.\"","","\"Not so, your Majesty,\" said the vizier, \"I beseech you. Let the facts","of the case be thoroughly investigated. How is it?\" he continued,","turning to the two young men. \"Why have you done this cruel thing?\"","","\"I shot an arrow at a bird that was sitting on the sill of an open","window in yonder house, and missed,\" answered the prince. \"I suppose","the arrow struck the merchant's wife. Had I known that she or anybody","had been near I should not have shot in that direction.\"","","\"We will speak of this later on,\" said the king, on hearing this","answer. \"Dismiss the people. Their presence is no longer needed.\"","","In the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk","about their two sons. The king wished both of them to be executed; but","the vizier suggested that the prince should be banished from the","country. This was finally agreed to.","","Accordingly, on the following morning, a little company of soldiers","escorted the prince out of the city. When they reached the last","custom-house the vizier's son overtook them. He had come with all","haste, bringing with him four bags of muhrs on four horses. \"I am","come,\" he said, throwing his arms round the prince's neck, \"because I","cannot let you go alone. We have lived together, we will be exiled","together, and we will die together. Turn me not back, if you love me.\"","","\"Consider,\" the prince answered, \"what you are doing. All kinds of","trial may be before me. Why should you leave your home and country to","be with me?\"","","\"Because I love you,\" he said, \"and shall never be happy without you.\"","","So the two friends walked along hand in hand as fast as they could to","get out of the country, and behind them marched the soldiers and the","horses with their valuable burdens. On reaching a place on the borders","of the king's dominions the prince gave the soldiers some gold, and","ordered them to return. The soldiers took the money and left; they did","not, however, go very far, but hid themselves behind rocks and stones,","and waited till they were quite sure that the prince did not intend to","come back.","","On and on the exiles walked, till they arrived at a certain village,","where they determined to spend the night under one of the big trees of","the place. The prince made preparations for a fire, and arranged the","few articles of bedding that they had with them, while the vizier's","son went to the baniya and the baker and the butcher to get something","for their dinner. For some reason he was delayed; perhaps the tsut was","not quite ready, or the baniya had not got all the spices prepared.","After waiting half an hour the prince became impatient, and rose up","and walked about.","","He saw a pretty, clear little brook running along not far from their","resting-place, and hearing that its source was not far distant, he","started off to find it. The source was a beautiful lake, which at that","time was covered with the magnificent lotus flower and other water","plants. The prince sat down on the bank, and being thirsty took up","some of the water in his hand. Fortunately he looked into his hand","before drinking, and there, to his great astonishment, he saw","reflected whole and clear the image of a beautiful fairy. He looked","round, hoping to see the reality; but seeing no person, he drank the","water, and put out his hand to take some more. Again he saw the","reflection in the water which was in his palm. He looked around as","before, and this time discovered a fairy sitting by the bank on the","opposite side of the lake. On seeing her he fell so madly in love with","her that he dropped down in a swoon.","","When the vizier's son returned, and found the fire lighted, the horses","securely fastened, and the bags of muhrs lying altogether in a heap,","but no prince, he did not know what to think. He waited a little","while, and then shouted; but not getting any reply, he got up and went","to the brook. There he came across the footmarks of his friend. Seeing","these, he went back at once for the money and the horses, and bringing","them with him, he tracked the prince to the lake, where he found him","lying to all appearance dead.","","\"Alas! alas!\" he cried, and lifting up the prince, he poured some","water over his head and face. \"Alas! my brother, what is this? Oh! do","not die and leave me thus. Speak, speak! I cannot bear this!\"","","In a few minutes the prince, revived by the water, opened his eyes,","and looked about wildly.","","\"Thank God!\" exclaimed the vizier's son. \"But what is the matter,","brother?\"","","\"Go away,\" replied the prince. \"I don't want to say anything to you,","or to see you. Go away.\"","","\"Come, come; let us leave this place. Look, I have brought some food","for you, and horses, and everything. Let us eat and depart.\"","","\"Go alone,\" replied the prince.","","\"Never,\" said the vizier's son. \"What has happened to suddenly","estrange you from me? A little while ago we were brethren, but now you","detest the sight of me.\"","","\"I have looked upon a fairy,\" the prince said. \"But a moment I saw her","face; for when she noticed that I was looking at her she covered her","face with lotus petals. Oh, how beautiful she was! And while I gazed","she took out of her bosom an ivory box, and held it up to me. Then I","fainted. Oh! if you can get me that fairy for my wife, I will go","anywhere with you.\"","","\"Oh, brother,\" said the vizier's son, \"you have indeed seen a fairy.","She is a fairy of the fairies. This is none other than Gulizar of the","Ivory City. I know this from the signs that she gave you. From her","covering her face with lotus petals I learn her name, and from her","showing you the ivory box I learn where she lives. Be patient, and","rest assured that I will arrange your marriage with her.\"","","When the prince heard these encouraging words he felt much comforted,","rose up, and ate, and then went away gladly with his friend.","","On the way they met two men. These two men belonged to a family of","robbers. There were eleven of them altogether. One, an elder sister,","stayed at home and cooked the food, and the other ten--all","brothers--went out, two and two, and walked about the four different","ways that ran through that part of the country, robbing those","travellers who could not resist them, and inviting others, who were","too powerful for two of them to manage, to come and rest at their","house, where the whole family attacked them and stole their goods.","These thieves lived in a kind of tower, which had several strong-rooms","in it, and under it was a great pit, wherein they threw the corpses of","the poor unfortunates who chanced to fall into their power.","","The two men came forward, and, politely accosting them, begged them to","come and stay at their house for the night. \"It is late,\" they said,","\"and there is not another village within several miles.\"","","\"Shall we accept this good man's invitation, brother?\" asked the","prince.","","The vizier's son frowned slightly in token of disapproval; but the","prince was tired, and thinking that it was only a whim of his","friend's, he said to the men, \"Very well. It is very kind of you to","ask us.\"","","So they all four went to the robbers' tower.","","Seated in a room, with the door fastened on the outside, the two","travellers bemoaned their fate.","","\"It is no good groaning,\" said the vizier's son. \"I will climb to the","window, and see whether there are any means of escape. Yes! yes!\" he","whispered, when he had reached the window-hole. \"Below there is a","ditch surrounded by a high wall. I will jump down and reconnoitre. You","stay here, and wait till I return.\"","","Presently he came back and told the prince that he had seen a most","ugly woman, whom he supposed was the robbers' housekeeper. She had","agreed to release them on the promise of her marriage with the prince.","","So the woman led the way out of the enclosure by a secret door.","","\"But where are the horses and the goods?\" the vizier's son inquired.","","\"You cannot bring them,\" the woman said. \"To go out by any other way","would be to thrust oneself into the grave.\"","","\"All right, then; they also shall go out by this door. I have a charm,","whereby I can make them thin or fat.\" So the vizier's son fetched the","horses without any person knowing it, and repeating the charm, he made","them pass through the narrow doorway like pieces of cloth, and when","they were all outside restored them to their former condition. He at","once mounted his horse and laid hold of the halter of one of the other","horses, and then beckoning to the prince to do likewise, he rode off.","The prince saw his opportunity, and in a moment was riding after him,","having the woman behind him.","","Now the robbers heard the galloping of the horses, and ran out and","shot their arrows at the prince and his companions. And one of the","arrows killed the woman, so they had to leave her behind.","","On, on they rode, until they reached a village where they stayed the","night. The following morning they were off again, and asked for Ivory","City from every passer-by. At length they came to this famous city,","and put up at a little hut that belonged to an old woman, from whom","they feared no harm, and with whom, therefore, they could abide in","peace and comfort. At first the old woman did not like the idea of","these travellers staying in her house, but the sight of a muhr, which","the prince dropped in the bottom of a cup in which she had given him","water, and a present of another muhr from the vizier's son, quickly","made her change her mind. She agreed to let them stay there for a few","days.","","As soon as her work was over the old woman came and sat down with her","lodgers. The vizier's son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the","place and people. \"Has this city a name?\" he asked the old woman.","","\"Of course it has, you stupid. Every little village, much more a city,","and such a city as this, has a name.\"","","\"What is the name of this city?\"","","\"Ivory City. Don't you know that? I thought the name was known all","over the world.\"","","On the mention of the name Ivory City the prince gave a deep sigh. The","vizier's son looked as much as to say, \"Keep quiet, or you'll discover","the secret.\"","","\"Is there a king of this country?\" continued the vizier's son.","","\"Of course there is, and a queen, and a princess.\"","","\"What are their names?\"","","\"The name of the princess is Gulizar, and the name of the queen----\"","","The vizier's son interrupted the old woman by turning to look at the","prince, who was staring like a madman. \"Yes,\" he said to him","afterwards, \"we are in the right country. We shall see the beautiful","princess.\"","","One morning the two travellers noticed the old woman's most careful","toilette: how careful she was in the arrangement of her hair and the","set of her kasabah and puts.","","\"Who is coming?\" said the vizier's son.","","\"Nobody,\" the old woman replied.","","\"Then where are you going?\"","","\"I am going to see my daughter, who is a servant of the Princess","Gulizar. I see her and the princess every day. I should have gone","yesterday, if you had not been here and taken up all my time.\"","","\"Ah-h-h! Be careful not to say anything about us in the hearing of the","princess.\" The vizier's son asked her not to speak about them at the","palace, hoping that, because she had been told not to do so, she would","mention their arrival, and thus the princess would be informed of","their coming.","","On seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry. \"Why have","you not been for two days?\" she asked.","","\"Because, my dear,\" the old woman answered, \"two young travellers, a","prince and the son of some great vizier, have taken up their abode in","my hut, and demand so much of my attention. It is nothing but cooking","and cleaning, and cleaning and cooking, all day long. I can't","understand the men,\" she added; \"one of them especially appears very","stupid. He asked me the name of this country and the name of the","king. Now where can these men have come from, that they do not know","these things? However, they are very great and very rich. They each","give me a muhr every morning and every evening.\"","","After this the old woman went and repeated almost the same words to","the princess, on the hearing of which the princess beat her severely;","and threatened her with a severer punishment if she ever again spoke","of the strangers before her.","","In the evening, when the old woman had returned to her hut, she told","the vizier's son how sorry she was that she could not help breaking","her promise, and how the princess had struck her because she mentioned","their coming and all about them.","","\"Alas! alas!\" said the prince, who had eagerly listened to every word.","\"What, then, will be her anger at the sight of a man?\"","","\"Anger?\" said the vizier's son, with an astonished air. \"She would be","exceedingly glad to see one man. I know this. In this treatment of the","old woman I see her request that you will go and see her during the","coming dark fortnight.\"","","\"Heaven be praised!\" the prince exclaimed.","","The next time the old woman went to the palace Gulizar called one of","her servants and ordered her to rush into the room while she was","conversing with the old woman; and if the old woman asked what was the","matter, she was to say that the king's elephants had gone mad, and","were rushing about the city and bazaar in every direction, and","destroying everything in their way.","","The servant obeyed, and the old woman, fearing lest the elephants","should go and push down her hut and kill the prince and his friend,","begged the princess to let her depart. Now Gulizar had obtained a","charmed swing, that landed whoever sat on it at the place wherever","they wished to be. \"Get the swing,\" she said to one of the servants","standing by. When it was brought she bade the old woman step into it","and desire to be at home.","","The old woman did so, and was at once carried through the air quickly","and safely to her hut, where she found her two lodgers safe and sound.","\"Oh!\" she cried, \"I thought that both of you would be killed by this","time. The royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly.","When I heard this I was anxious about you. So the princess gave me","this charmed swing to return in. But come, let us get outside before","the elephants arrive and batter down the place.\"","","\"Don't believe this,\" said the vizier's son. \"It is a mere hoax. They","have been playing tricks with you.\"","","\"You will soon have your heart's desire,\" he whispered aside to the","prince. \"These things are signs.\"","","Two days of the dark fortnight had elapsed, when the prince and the","vizier's son seated themselves in the swing, and wished themselves","within the grounds of the palace. In a moment they were there, and","there too was the object of their search standing by one of the palace","gates, and longing to see the prince quite as much as he was longing","to see her.","","Oh, what a happy meeting it was!","","\"At last,\" said Gulizar, \"I have seen my beloved, my husband.\"","","\"A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you,\" said the prince.","","Then the prince and Gulizar betrothed themselves to one another and","parted, the one for the hut and the other for the palace, both of them","feeling happier than they had ever been before.","","Henceforth the prince visited Gulizar every day and returned to the","hut every night. One morning Gulizar begged him to stay with her","always. She was constantly afraid of some evil happening to","him--perhaps robbers would slay him, or sickness attack him, and then","she would be deprived of him. She could not live without seeing him.","The prince showed her that there was no real cause for fear, and said","that he felt he ought to return to his friend at night, because he had","left his home and country and risked his life for him; and, moreover,","if it had not been for his friend's help he would never have met with","her.","","Gulizar for the time assented, but she determined in her heart to get","rid of the vizier's son as soon as possible. A few days after this","conversation she ordered one of her maids to make a pilaw. She gave","special directions that a certain poison was to be mixed into it while","cooking, and as soon as it was ready the cover was to be placed on the","saucepan, so that the poisonous steam might not escape. When the pilaw","was ready she sent it at once by the hand of a servant to the vizier's","son with this message: \"Gulizar, the princess, sends you an offering","in the name of her dead uncle.\"","","On receiving the present the vizier's son thought that the prince had","spoken gratefully of him to the princess, and therefore she had thus","remembered him. Accordingly he sent back his salam and expressions of","thankfulness.","","When it was dinner-time he took the saucepan of pilaw and went out to","eat it by the stream. Taking off the lid, he threw it aside on the","grass and then washed his hands. During the minute or so that he was","performing these ablutions, the green grass under the cover of the","saucepan turned quite yellow. He was astonished, and suspecting that","there was poison in the pilaw, he took a little and threw it to some","crows that were hopping about. The moment the crows ate what was","thrown to them they fell down dead.","","\"Heaven be praised,\" exclaimed the vizier's son, \"who has preserved me","from death at this time!\"","","On the return of the prince that evening the vizier's son was very","reticent and depressed. The prince noticed this change in him, and","asked what was the reason. \"Is it because I am away so much at the","palace?\" The vizier's son saw that the prince had nothing to do with","the sending of the pilaw, and therefore told him everything.","","\"Look here,\" he said, \"in this handkerchief is some pilaw that the","princess sent me this morning in the name of her deceased uncle. It is","saturated with poison. Thank Heaven, I discovered it in time!\"","","\"Oh, brother! who could have done this thing? Who is there that","entertains enmity against you?\"","","\"The Princess Gulizar. Listen. The next time you go to see her, I","entreat you to take some snow with you; and just before seeing the","princess put a little of it into both your eyes. It will provoke","tears, and Gulizar will ask you why you are crying. Tell her that you","weep for the loss of your friend, who died suddenly this morning.","Look! take, too, this wine and this shovel, and when you have feigned","intense grief at the death of your friend, bid the princess to drink a","little of the wine. It is strong, and will immediately send her into a","deep sleep. Then, while she is asleep, heat the shovel and mark her","back with it. Remember to bring back the shovel again, and also to","take her pearl necklace. This done, return. Now fear not to execute","these instructions, because on the fulfilment of them depends your","fortune and happiness. I will arrange that your marriage with the","princess shall be accepted by the king, her father, and all the","court.\"","","The prince promised that he would do everything as the vizier's son","had advised him; and he kept his promise.","","The following night, on the return of the prince from his visit to","Gulizar, he and the vizier's son, taking the horses and bags of muhrs,","went to a graveyard about a mile or so distant. It was arranged that","the vizier's son should act the part of a fakir and the prince the","part of the fakir's disciple and servant.","","In the morning, when Gulizar had returned to her senses, she felt a","smarting pain in her back, and noticed that her pearl necklace was","gone. She went at once and informed the king of the loss of her","necklace, but said nothing to him about the pain in her back.","","The king was very angry when he heard of the theft, and caused","proclamation concerning it to be made throughout all the city and","surrounding country.","","\"It is well,\" said the vizier's son, when he heard of this","proclamation. \"Fear not, my brother, but go and take this necklace,","and try to sell it in the bazaar.\"","","The prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.","","\"How much do you want for it?\" asked the man.","","\"Fifty thousand rupees,\" the prince replied.","","\"All right,\" said the man; \"wait here while I go and fetch the money.\"","","The prince waited and waited, till at last the goldsmith returned,","and with him the kotwal, who at once took the prince into custody on","the charge of stealing the princess's necklace.","","\"How did you get the necklace?\" the kotwal asked.","","\"A fakir, whose servant I am, gave it to me to sell in the bazaar,\"","the prince replied. \"Permit me, and I will show you where he is.\"","","The prince directed the kotwal and the policeman to the place where he","had left the vizier's son, and there they found the fakir with his","eyes shut and engaged in prayer. Presently, when he had finished his","devotions, the kotwal asked him to explain how he had obtained","possession of the princess's necklace.","","\"Call the king hither,\" he replied, \"and then I will tell his Majesty","face to face.\"","","On this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had","said. His Majesty came, and seeing the fakir so solemn and earnest in","his devotions, he was afraid to rouse his anger, lest peradventure the","displeasure of Heaven should descend on him, and so he placed his","hands together in the attitude of a supplicant, and asked, \"How did","you get my daughter's necklace?\"","","\"Last night,\" replied the fakir, \"we were sitting here by this tomb","worshipping Khuda, when a ghoul, dressed as a princess, came and","exhumed a body that had been buried a few days ago, and began to eat","it. On seeing this I was filled with anger, and beat her back with a","shovel, which lay on the fire at the time. While running away from me","her necklace got loose and dropped. You wonder at these words, but","they are not difficult to prove. Examine your daughter, and you will","find the marks of the burn on her back. Go, and if it is as I say,","send the princess to me, and I will punish her.\"","","The king went back to the palace, and at once ordered the princess's","back to be examined.","","\"It is so,\" said the maid-servant; \"the burn is there.\"","","\"Then let the girl be slain immediately,\" the king shouted.","","\"No, no, your Majesty,\" they replied. \"Let us send her to the fakir","who discovered this thing, that he may do whatever he wishes with","her.\"","","The king agreed, and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.","","\"Let her be shut up in a cage, and be kept near the grave whence she","took out the corpse,\" said the fakir.","","This was done, and in a little while the fakir and his disciple and","the princess were left alone in the graveyard. Night had not long cast","its dark mantle over the scene when the fakir and his disciple threw","off their disguise, and taking their horses and luggage, appeared","before the cage. They released the princess, rubbed some ointment over","the scars on her back, and then sat her upon one of their horses","behind the prince. Away they rode fast and far, and by the morning","were able to rest and talk over their plans in safety. The vizier's","son showed the princess some of the poisoned pilaw that she had sent","him, and asked whether she had repented of her ingratitude. The","princess wept, and acknowledged that he was her greatest helper and","friend.","","A letter was sent to the chief vizier telling him of all that had","happened to the prince and the vizier's son since they had left their","country. When the vizier read the letter he went and informed the","king. The king caused a reply to be sent to the two exiles, in which","he ordered them not to return, but to send a letter to Gulizar's","father, and inform him of everything. Accordingly they did this; the","prince wrote the letter at the vizier's son's dictation.","","On reading the letter Gulizar's father was much enraged with his","viziers and other officials for not discovering the presence in his","country of these illustrious visitors, as he was especially anxious to","ingratiate himself in the favour of the prince and the vizier's son.","He ordered the execution of some of the viziers on a certain date.","","\"Come,\" he wrote back to the vizier's son, \"and stay at the palace.","And if the prince desires it, I will arrange for his marriage with","Gulizar as soon as possible.\"","","The prince and the vizier's son most gladly accepted the invitation,","and received a right noble welcome from the king. The marriage soon","took place, and then after a few weeks the king gave them presents of","horses and elephants, and jewels and rich cloths, and bade them start","for their own land; for he was sure that the king would now receive","them. The night before they left the viziers and others, whom the king","intended to have executed as soon as his visitors had left, came and","besought the vizier's son to plead for them, and promised that they","each would give him a daughter in marriage. He agreed to do so, and","succeeded in obtaining their pardon.","","Then the prince, with his beautiful bride Gulizar, and the vizier's","son, attended by a troop of soldiers, and a large number of camels and","horses bearing very much treasure, left for their own land. In the","midst of the way they passed the tower of the robbers, and with the","help of the soldiers they razed it to the ground, slew all its","inmates, and seized the treasure which they had been amassing there","for several years.","","At length they reached their own country, and when the king saw his","son's beautiful wife and his magnificent retinue he was at once","reconciled, and ordered him to enter the city and take up his abode","there.","","Henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince. He became a","great favourite, and in due time succeeded to the throne, and ruled","the country for many, many years in peace and happiness.","","","","","How Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to Dinner","","[Illustration:]","","","One day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and","aunts Thunder and Lightning. Their mother (one of the most distant","Stars you see far up in the sky) waited alone for her children's","return.","","Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish. They enjoyed the great","feast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving any","of it to take home to their mother--but the gentle Moon did not","forget her. Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a","small portion under one of her beautiful long finger-nails, that Star","might also have a share in the treat.","","On their return, their mother, who had kept watch for them all night","long with her little bright eye, said, \"Well, children, what have you","brought home for me?\" Then Sun (who was eldest) said, \"I have brought","nothing home for you. I went out to enjoy myself with my friends--not","to fetch a dinner for my mother!\" And Wind said, \"Neither have I","brought anything home for you, mother. You could hardly expect me to","bring a collection of good things for you, when I merely went out for","my own pleasure.\" But Moon said, \"Mother, fetch a plate, see what I","have brought you.\" And shaking her hands she showered down such a","choice dinner as never was seen before.","","Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, \"Because you went out to amuse","yourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, without","any thought of your mother at home--you shall be cursed. Henceforth,","your rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that","they touch. And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you","appear.\"","","(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)","","Then she turned to Wind and said, \"You also who forgot your mother in","the midst of your selfish pleasures--hear your doom. You shall always","blow in the hot dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all living","things. And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time.\"","","(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so","disagreeable.)","","But to Moon she said, \"Daughter, because you remembered your mother,","and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth you","shall be ever cool, and calm, and bright. No noxious glare shall","accompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you 'blessed.'\"","","(And that is why the moon's light is so soft, and cool, and beautiful","even to this day.)","","","","","How the Wicked Sons were Duped.","","","A very wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,","sent for his sons and divided his property among them. However, he did","not die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them","were. Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear","with much abuse and cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates!","Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their","father, hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received","their patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them--nay, the sooner","the better, because he was only a needless trouble and expense. And","they let the poor old man know what they felt.","","One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The","friend sympathised very much with him, and promised to think over the","matter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so;","in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of","stones and gravel before him.","","\"Look here, friend,\" said he. \"Your sons will get to know of my coming","here to-day, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I came","to discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are several","thousands of rupees richer than you thought you were. Keep these bags","in your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as long","as you are alive. You will soon find them change their conduct towards","you. Salaam. I will come again soon to see how you are getting on.\"","","When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they","began to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever","before. And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise,","when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stones","and gravel!","","","","","The Pigeon and the Crow","","[Illustration:]","","","Once upon a time the Bodhisatta was a Pigeon, and lived in a","nest-basket which a rich man's cook had hung up in the kitchen, in","order to earn merit by it. A greedy Crow, flying near, saw all sorts","of delicate food lying about in the kitchen, and fell a-hungering","after it. \"How in the world can I get some?\" thought he? At last he","hit upon a plan.","","When the Pigeon went to search for food, behind him, following,","following, came the Crow.","","\"What do you want, Mr. Crow? You and I don't feed alike.\"","","\"Ah, but I like you and your ways! Let me be your chum, and let us","feed together.\"","","The Pigeon agreed, and they went on in company. The Crow pretended to","feed along with the Pigeon, but ever and anon he would turn back, peck","to bits some heap of cow-dung, and eat a fat worm. When he had got a","bellyful of them, up he flies, as pert as you like:","","\"Hullo, Mr. Pigeon, what a time you take over your meal! One ought to","draw the line somewhere. Let's be going home before it is too late.\"","And so they did.","","The cook saw that his Pigeon had brought a friend, and hung up another","basket for him.","","A few days afterwards there was a great purchase of fish which came to","the rich man's kitchen. How the Crow longed for some! So there he lay,","from early morn, groaning and making a great noise. Says the Pigeon to","the Crow:","","\"Come, Sir Crow, and get your breakfast!\"","","\"Oh dear! oh dear! I have such a fit of indigestion!\" says he.","","\"Nonsense! Crows never have indigestion,\" said the Pigeon. \"If you eat","a lamp-wick, that stays in your stomach a little while; but anything","else is digested in a trice, as soon as you eat it. Now do what I tell","you; don't behave in this way just for seeing a little fish.\"","","\"Why do you say that, master? I have indigestion.\"","","\"Well, be careful,\" said the Pigeon, and flew away.","","The cook prepared all the dishes, and then stood at the kitchen door,","wiping the sweat off his body. \"Now's my time!\" thought Mr. Crow, and","alighted on a dish containing some dainty food. Click! The cook heard","it, and looked round. Ah! he caught the Crow, and plucked all the","feathers out of his head, all but one tuft; he powdered ginger and","cummin, mixed it up with butter-milk, and rubbed it well all over the","bird's body.","","\"That's for spoiling my master's dinner and making me throw it away!\"","said he, and threw him into his basket. Oh, how it hurt!","","By-and-by the Pigeon came in, and saw the Crow lying there, making a","great noise. He made great game of him, and repeated a verse of","poetry:","","    \"Who is this tufted crane I see","    Lying where he's no right to be?","    Come out! my friend, the crow is near,","    And he may do you harm, I fear!\"","","To this the Crow answered with another:","","    \"No tufted crane am I--no, no!","    I'm nothing but a greedy crow.","    I would not do as I was told,","    So now I'm plucked, as you behold.\"","","And the Pigeon rejoined with a third verse:","","    \"You'll come to grief again, I know--","    It is your nature to do so;","    If people make a dish of meat,","    'Tis not for little birds to eat.\"","","Then the Pigeon flew away, saying: \"I can't live with this creature","any longer.\" And the Crow lay there groaning till he died.","","","","","Notes and References","","","The story literature of India is in a large measure the outcome of the","moral revolution of the peninsula connected with the name of Gautama","Buddha. As the influence of his life and doctrines grew, a tendency","arose to connect all the popular stories of India round the great","teacher. This could be easily effected owing to the wide spread of the","belief in metempsychosis. All that was told of the sages of the past","could be interpreted of the Buddha by representing them as","pre-incarnations of him. Even with Fables, or beast-tales, this could","be done, for the Hindoos were Darwinists long before Darwin, and","regarded beasts as cousins of men and stages of development in the","progress of the soul through the ages. Thus, by identifying the Buddha","with the heroes of all folk-tales and the chief characters in the","beast-drolls, the Buddhists were enabled to incorporate the whole of","the story-store of Hindostan in their sacred books, and enlist on","their side the tale-telling instincts of men.","","In making Buddha the centre figure of the popular literature of India,","his followers also invented the Frame as a method of literary art. The","idea of connecting a number of disconnected stories familiar to us","from _The Arabian Nights_, Boccaccio's _Decamerone_, Chaucer's","_Canterbury Tales_, or even _Pickwick_, is directly traceable to the","plan of making Buddha the central figure of India folk-literature.","Curiously enough, the earliest instance of this in Buddhist literature","was intended to be a Decameron, ten tales of Buddha's previous births,","told of each of the ten Perfections. Asvagosha, the earlier Boccaccio,","died when he had completed thirty-four of the Birth-Tales. But other","collections were made, and at last a corpus of the JATAKAS, or","Birth-Tales of the Buddha, was carried over to Ceylon, possibly as","early as the first introduction of Buddhism, 241 B.C. There they have","remained till the present day, and have at last been made accessible","in a complete edition in the original Pali by Prof. Fausböll.","","These JATAKAS, as we now have them, are enshrined in a commentary on","the _gathas_, or moral verses, written in Ceylon by one of","Buddhaghosa's school in the fifth century A.D. They invariably begin","with a \"Story of the Present,\" an incident in Buddha's life which","calls up to him a \"Story of the Past,\" a folk-tale in which he had","played a part during one of his former incarnations. Thus the fable of","the Lion and the Crane, which opens the present collection, is","introduced by a \"Story of the Present\" in the following words:--","","\"A service have we done thee\" [the opening words of the _gatha_ or","moral verse]. \"This the Master told while living at Jetavana","concerning Devadatta's treachery. Not only now, O Bhickkus, but in a","former existence was Devadatta ungrateful. And having said this he","told a tale.\" Then follows the tale as given above (pp. 1, 2), and the","commentary concludes: \"The Master, having given the lesson, summed up","the Jataka thus: 'At that time, the Lion was Devadatta, and the Crane","was I myself.'\" Similarly, with each story of the past the Buddha","identifies himself, or is mentioned as identical with, the virtuous","hero of the folk-tale. These Jatakas are 550 in number, and have been","reckoned to include some 2000 tales. Some of these had been translated","by Mr. Rhys-Davids (_Buddhist Birth Stories, I._, Trübner's Oriental","Library, 1880), Prof. Fausböll (_Five Jatakas_, Copenhagen), and Dr.","R. Morris (_Folk-Lore Journal_, vols. ii.-v.). A few exist sculptured","on the earliest Buddhist Stupas. Thus several of the circular figure","designs on the reliefs from Amaravati, now on the grand staircase of","the British Museum, represent Jatakas, or previous births of the","Buddha.","","Some of the Jatakas bear a remarkable resemblance to some of the most","familiar FABLES OF ÆSOP. So close is the resemblance, indeed, that it is","impossible not to surmise an historical relation between the two. What this","relation is I have discussed at considerable length in the \"History of the","Æsopic Fable,\" which forms the introductory volume to my edition of","Caxton's _Esope_ (London, D. Nutt, \"Bibliothèque de Carabas,\" 1889). In","this place I can only roughly summarise my results. I conjecture that a","collection of fables existed in India before Buddha and independently of","the Jatakas, and connected with the name of Kasyapa, who was afterwards","made by the Buddhists into the latest of the twenty-seven pre-incarnations","of the Buddha. This collection of the Fables of Kasyapa was brought to","Europe with a deputation from the Cingalese King Chandra Muka Siwa (obiit","52 A.D.) to the Emperor Claudius about 50 A.D., and was done into Greek as","the Λὁγοι Λυβικοἱ of \"Kybises.\" These were utilised by Babrius (from whom","the Greek Æsop is derived) and Avian, and so came into the European Æsop.","I have discussed all those that are to be found in the Jatakas in the","\"History\" before mentioned, i. pp. 54-72 (see Notes i. xv. xx.). In these","Notes henceforth I refer to this \"History\" as my _Æsop_.","","There were probably other Buddhist collections of a similar nature to","the Jatakas with a framework. When the Hindu reaction against Buddhism","came, the Brahmins adapted these, with the omission of Buddha as the","central figure. There is scarcely any doubt that the so-called FABLES","OF BIDPAI were thus derived from Buddhistic sources. In its Indian","form this is now extant as a _Panchatantra_ or Pentateuch, five books","of tales connected by a Frame. This collection is of special interest","to us in the present connection, as it has come to Europe in various","forms and shapes. I have edited Sir Thomas North's English version of","an Italian adaptation of a Spanish translation of a Latin version of a","Hebrew translation of an Arabic adaptation of the Pehlevi version of","the Indian original (_Fables of Bidpai_, London, D. Nutt,","\"Bibliothèque de Carabas,\" 1888). In this I give a genealogical table","of the various versions, from which I calculate that the tales have","been translated into thirty-eight languages in 112 different versions,","twenty different ones in English alone. Their influence on European","folk-tales has been very great: it is probable that nearly one-tenth","of these can be traced to the Bidpai literature. (See Notes v. ix. x.","xiii. xv.)","","Other collections of a similar character, arranged in a frame, and","derived ultimately from Buddhistic sources, also reached Europe and","formed popular reading in the Middle Ages. Among these may be","mentioned THE TALES OF SINDIBAD, known to Europe as _The Seven Sages","of Rome:_ from this we get the Gellert story (_cf. Celtic Fairy","Tales_), though it also occurs in the Bidpai. Another popular","collection was that associated with the life of St. Buddha, who has","been canonised as St. Josaphat: BARLAAM AND JOSAPHAT tells of his","conversion and much else besides, including the tale of the Three","Caskets, used by Shakespeare in the _Merchant of Venice_.","","Some of the Indian tales reached Europe at the time of the Crusades,","either orally or in collections no longer extant. The earliest","selection of these was the _Disciplina Clericalis_ of Petrus Alphonsi,","a Spanish Jew converted about 1106: his tales were to be used as","seasoning for sermons, and strong seasoning they must have proved.","Another Spanish collection of considerably later date was entitled _El","Conde Lucanor_ (Eng. trans. by W. York): this contains the fable of","_The Man, his Son, and their Ass_, which they ride or carry as the","popular voice decides. But the most famous collection of this kind","was that known as GESTA ROMANORUM, much of which was certainly derived","from Oriental and ultimately Indian sources, and so might more","appropriately be termed _Gesta Indorum_.","","All these collections, which reached Europe in the twelfth and","thirteenth centuries, became very popular, and were used by monks and","friars to enliven their sermons as EXEMPLA. Prof. Crane has given a","full account of this very curious phenomenon in his erudite edition of","the _Exempla of Jacques de Vitry_ (Folk Lore Society, 1890). The","Indian stories were also used by the Italian _Novellieri_, much of","Boccaccio and his school being derived from this source. As these","again gave material for the Elizabethan Drama, chiefly in W. Painter's","_Palace of Pleasure_, a collection of translated _Novelle_ which I","have edited (Lond., 3 vols. 1890), it is not surprising that we can at","times trace portions of Shakespeare back to India. It should also be","mentioned that one-half of La Fontaine's Fables (Bks. vii.-xii.) are","derived from Indian sources. (_See_ Note on No. v.)","","In India itself the collection of stories in frames went on and still","goes on. Besides those already mentioned there are the stories of","_Vikram and the Vampire_ (Vetala), translated among others by the late","Sir Richard Burton, and the seventy stories of a parrot (_Suka","Saptati_). The whole of this literature was summed up by Somadeva, c.","1200 A.D. in a huge compilation entitled _Katha Sarit Sagara_ (\"Ocean","of the Stream of Stories\"). Of this work, written in very florid","style, Mr. Tawney has produced a translation in two volumes in the","_Bibliotheca Indica_. Unfortunately, there is a Divorce Court","atmosphere about the whole book, and my selections from it have been","accordingly restricted. (Notes, No. xi.)","","So much for a short sketch of Indian folk-tales so far as they have","been reduced to writing in the native literature.[2] The Jatakas are","probably the oldest collection of such tales in literature, and the","greater part of the rest are demonstrably more than a thousand years","old. It is certain that much (perhaps one-fifth) of the popular","literature of modern Europe is derived from those portions of this","large bulk which came west with the Crusades through the medium of","Arabs and Jews. In his elaborate _Einleitung_ to the _Pantschatantra_,","the Indian version of the Fables of Bidpai, Prof. Benfey contended","with enormous erudition that the majority of folk-tale incidents were","to be found in the Bidpai literature. His introduction consisted of","over 200 monographs on the spread of Indian tales to Europe. He wrote","in 1859, before the great outburst of folk-tale collection in Europe,","and he had not thus adequate materials to go about in determining the","extent of Indian influence on the popular mind of Europe. But he made","it clear that for beast-tales and for drolls, the majority of those","current in the mouths of occidental people were derived from Eastern","and mainly Indian sources. He was not successful, in my opinion, in","tracing the serious fairy tale to India. Few of the tales in the","Indian literary collections could be dignified by the name of fairy","tales, and it was clear that if these were to be traced to India, an","examination of the contemporary folk-tales of the peninsula would have","to be attempted.","","[Footnote 2: An admirable and full account of this literature was","given by M. A. Barth in _Mélusine_, t. iv. No. 12, and t. v. No. 1.","See also Table i. of Prof. Rhys-Davids' _Birth Stories_.]","","The collection of current Indian folk-tales has been the work of the","last quarter of a century, a work, even after what has been achieved,","still in its initial stages. The credit of having begun the process is","due to Miss Frere, who, while her father was Governor of the Bombay","Presidency, took down from the lips of her _ayah_, Anna de Souza, one","of a Lingaet family from Goa who had been Christian for three","generations, the tales she afterwards published with Mr. Murray in","1868, under the title, \"_Old Deccan Days, or, Indian Fairy Legends","current in Southern India, collected from oral tradition by M. Frere,","with an introduction and notes by Sir Bartle Frere_.\" Her example was","followed by Miss Stokes in her _Indian Fairy Tales_ (London, Ellis \u0026","White, 1880), who took down her tales from two _ayahs_ and a","_Khitmatgar_, all of them Bengalese--the _ayahs_ Hindus, and the man a","Mohammedan. Mr. Ralston introduced the volume with some remarks which","dealt too much with sun-myths for present-day taste. Another","collection from Bengal was that of Lal Behari Day, a Hindu gentleman,","in his _Folk-Tales of Bengal_ (London, Macmillan, 1883). The Panjab","and the Kashmir then had their turn: Mrs. Steel collected, and Captain","(now Major) Temple edited and annotated, their _Wideawake Stories_","(London, Trübner, 1884), stories capitally told and admirably","annotated. Captain Temple increased the value of this collection by a","remarkable analysis of all the incidents contained in the two hundred","Indian folk-tales collected up to this date. It is not too much to say","that this analysis marks an onward step in the scientific study of the","folk-tale: there is such a thing, derided as it may be. I have","throughout the Notes been able to draw attention to Indian parallels","by a simple reference to Major Temple's Analysis.","","Major Temple has not alone himself collected: he has been the cause","that many others have collected. In the pages of the _Indian","Antiquary_, edited by him, there have appeared from time to time","folk-tales collected from all parts of India. Some of these have been","issued separately. Sets of tales from Southern India, collected by the","Pandit Natesa Sastri, have been issued under the title _Folk-Lore of","Southern India_, three fascicules of which have been recently","re-issued by Mrs. Kingscote under the title, _Tales of the Sun_ (W. H.","Allen, 1891): it would have been well if the identity of the two works","had been clearly explained. The largest addition to our knowledge of","the Indian folk-tale that has been made since _Wideawake Stories_ is","that contained in Mr. Knowles' _Folk-Tales of Kashmir_ (Trübner's","Oriental Library, 1887), sixty-three stories, some of great length.","These, with Mr. Campbell's _Santal Tales_ (1892); Ramaswami Raju's","_Indian Fables_ (London, Sonnenschein, n.d.); M. Thornhill, _Indian","Fairy Tales_ (London, 1889); and E. J. Robinson, _Tales of S. India_","(1885), together with those contained in books of travel like","Thornton's _Bannu_ or Smeaton's _Karens of Burmah_ bring up the list","of printed Indian folk-tales to over 350--a respectable total indeed,","but a mere drop in the ocean of the stream of stories that must exist","in such a huge population as that of India: the Central Provinces in","particular are practically unexplored. There are doubtless many","collections still unpublished. Col. Lewin has large numbers, besides","the few published in his _Lushai Grammar_; and Mr. M. L. Dames has a","number of Baluchi tales which I have been privileged to use.","Altogether, India now ranks among the best represented countries for","printed folk-tales, coming only after Russia (1500), Germany (1200),","Italy and France (1000 each.)[3] Counting the ancient with the modern,","India has probably some 600 to 700 folk-tales printed and translated","in accessible form. There should be enough material to determine the","vexed question of the relations between the European and the Indian","collections.","","[Footnote 3: Finland boasts of 12,000, but most of these lie unprinted","among the archives of the Helsingfors Literary Society.]","","This question has taken a new departure with the researches of M.","Emanuel Cosquin in his _Contes populaires de Lorraine_ (Paris, 1886,","2^e tirage, 1890), undoubtedly the most important contribution to the","scientific study of the folk-tale since the Grimms. M. Cosquin gives","in the annotations to the eighty-four tales which he has collected in","Lorraine a mass of information as to the various forms which the tales","take in other countries of Europe and in the East. In my opinion, the","work he has done for the European folk-tale is even more valuable than","the conclusions he draws from it as to the relations with India. He","has taken up the work which Wilhelm Grimm dropped in 1859, and shown","from the huge accumulations of folk-tales that have appeared during","the last thirty years that there is a common fund of folk-tales which","every country of Europe without exception possesses, though this does","not of course preclude them from possessing others that are not shared","by the rest. M. Cosquin further contends that the whole of these have","come from the East, ultimately from India, not by literary","transmission, as Benfey contended, but by oral transmission. He has","certainly shown that very many of the most striking incidents common","to European folk-tales are also to be found in Eastern _mährchen_.","What, however, he has failed to show is that some of these may not","have been carried out to the Eastern world by Europeans. Borrowing","tales is a mutual process, and when Indian meets European, European","meets Indian; which borrowed from which, is a question which we have","very few criteria to decide. It should be added that Mr W. A. Clouston","has in England collected with exemplary industry a large number of","parallels between Indian and European folk-tale incidents in his","_Popular Tales and Fictions_ (Edinburgh, 2 vols., 1887) and _Book of","Noodles_ (London, 1888). Mr Clouston has not openly expressed his","conviction that all folk-tales are Indian in origin: he prefers to","convince us _non vi sed sæpe cadendo_. He has certainly made out a","good case for tracing all European drolls, or comic folk-tales, from","the East.","","With the fairy tale strictly so called--_i.e._, the serious folk-tale","of romantic adventure--I am more doubtful. It is mainly a modern","product in India as in Europe, so far as literary evidence goes. The","vast bulk of the Jatakas does not contain a single example worthy the","name, nor does the Bidpai literature. Some of Somadeva's tales,","however, approach the nature of fairy tales, but there are several","Celtic tales which can be traced to an earlier date than his (1200","A.D.) and are equally near to fairy tales. Yet it is dangerous to","trust to mere non-appearance in literature as proof of non-existence","among the folk. To take our own tales here in England, there is not a","single instance of a reference to _Jack and the Beanstalk_ for the","last three hundred years, yet it is undoubtedly a true folk-tale. And","it is indeed remarkable how many of the _formulæ_ of fairy tales have","been found of recent years in India. Thus, the _Magic Fiddle_, found","among the Santals by Mr. Campbell in two variants (see Notes on vi.),","contains the germ idea of the wide-spread story represented in Great","Britain by the ballad of _Binnorie_ (see _English Fairy Tales_, No.","ix.). Similarly, Mr. Knowles' collection has added considerably to the","number of Indian variants of European \"formulæ\" beyond those noted by","M. Cosquin.","","It is still more striking as regards _incidents_. In a paper read","before the Folk-Lore Congress of 1891, and reprinted in the","_Transactions_, pp. 76 _seq._, I have drawn up a list of some 630","incidents found in common among European folk-tales (including","drolls). Of these, I reckon that about 250 have been already found","among Indian folk-tales, and the number is increased by each new","collection that is made or printed. The moral of this is, that India","belongs to a group of peoples who have a common store of stories;","India belongs to Europe for purposes of comparative folk-tales.","","Can we go further and say that India is the source of all the","incidents that are held in common by European children? I think we may","answer \"Yes\" as regards droll incidents, the travels of many of which","we can trace, and we have the curious result that European children","owe their earliest laughter to Hindu wags. As regards the serious","incidents further inquiry is needed. Thus, we find the incident of an","\"external soul\" (Life Index, Captain Temple very appropriately named","it) in Asbjornsen's _Norse Tales_ and in Miss Frere's _Old Deccan","Days_ (see Notes on _Punchkin_). Yet the latter is a very suspicious","source, since Miss Frere derived her tales from a Christian _ayah_","whose family had been in Portuguese Goa for a hundred years. May they","not have got the story of the giant with his soul outside his body","from some European sailor touching at Goa? This is to a certain extent","negatived by the fact of the frequent occurrence of the incident in","Indian folk-tales (Captain Temple gave a large number of instances in","_Wideawake Stories_, pp. 404-5). On the other hand, Mr. Frazer in his","_Golden Bough_ has shown the wide spread of the idea among all savage","or semi-savage tribes. (See Note on No. iv.)","","In this particular case we may be doubtful; but in others, again--as","the incident of the rat's tail up nose (see Notes on _The Charmed","Ring_)--there can be little doubt of the Indian origin. And generally,","so far as the incidents are marvellous and of true fairy-tale","character, the presumption is in favour of India, because of the","vitality of animism or metempsychosis in India throughout all historic","time. No Hindu would doubt the fact of animals speaking or of men","transformed into plants and animals. The European may once have had","these beliefs, and may still hold them implicitly as \"survivals\"; but","in the \"survival\" stage they cannot afford material for artistic","creation, and the fact that the higher minds of Europe for the last","thousand years have discountenanced these beliefs has not been","entirely without influence. Of one thing there is practical certainty:","the fairy tales that are common to the Indo-European world were","invented once for all in a certain locality, and thence spread to all","the countries in culture contact with the original source. The mere","fact that contiguous countries have more similarities in their story","store than distant ones is sufficient to prove this: indeed, the fact","that any single country has spread throughout it a definite set of","folk-tales as distinctive as its flora and fauna, is sufficient to","prove it. It is equally certain that not all folk-tales have come from","one source, for each country has tales peculiar to itself. The","question is as to the source of the tales that are common to all","European children, and increasing evidence seems to show that this","common nucleus is derived from India and India alone. The Hindus have","been more successful than others, because of two facts: they have had","the appropriate \"atmosphere\" of metempsychosis, and they have also had","spread among the people sufficient literary training and mental grip","to invent plots. The Hindu tales have ousted the native European,","which undoubtedly existed independently; indeed, many still survive,","especially in Celtic lands. Exactly in the same way, Perrault's tales","have ousted the older English folk-tales, and it is with the utmost","difficulty that one can get true English fairy tales because _Red","Riding Hood_, _Cinderella_, _Blue Beard_, _Puss in Boots_ and the","rest, have survived in the struggle for existence among English","folk-tales. So far as Europe has a common store of fairy tales, it","owes this to India.","","I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not hold with Benfey that all","European folk-tales are derived from the Bidpai literature and similar","literary products, nor with M. Cosquin that they are all derived from","India. The latter scholar has proved that there is a nucleus of","stories in every European land which is common to all. I calculate","that this includes from 30 to 50 per cent. of the whole, and it is","this common stock of Europe that I regard as coming from India mainly","at the time of the Crusades, and chiefly by oral transmission. It","includes all the beast tales and most of the drolls, but evidence is","still lacking about the more serious fairy tales, though it is","increasing with every fresh collection of folk-tales in India, the","great importance of which is obvious from the above considerations.","","In the following Notes I give, as on the two previous occasions, the","_source_ whence I derived the tale, then _parallels_, and finally","_remarks_. For Indian _parallels_ I have been able to refer to Major","Temple's remarkable Analysis of Indian Folk-tale incidents at the end","of _Wideawake Stories_ (pp. 386-436), for European ones to my","alphabetical List of Incidents, with bibliographical references, in","_Transactions of Folk-Lore Congress_, 1892, pp. 87-98. My _remarks_","have been mainly devoted to tracing the relation between the Indian","and the European tales, with the object of showing that the latter","have been derived from the former. I have, however, to some extent","handicapped myself, as I have avoided giving again the Indian versions","of stories already given in _English Fairy Tales_ or _Celtic Fairy","Tales_.","","","I. THE LION AND THE CRANE.","","_Source._--V. Fausböll, _Five Jātakas_, Copenhagen, 1861, pp. 35-8,","text and translation of the _Jāvasakuna Jātaka_. I have ventured","to English Prof. Fausböll's version, which was only intended as a","\"crib\" to the Pali. For the omitted Introduction, see _supra_.","","_Parallels._--I have given a rather full collection of parallels,","running to about a hundred numbers, in my _Æsop_, pp. 232-4. The chief","of these are: (1) for the East, the Midrashic version (\"Lion and","Egyptian Partridge\"), in the great Rabbinic commentary on Genesis","(_Bereshith-rabba_, c. 64); (2) in classical antiquity, Phædrus, i. 8","(\"Wolf and Crane\"), and Babrius, 94 (\"Wolf and Heron\"), and the Greek","proverb Suidas, ii. 248 (\"Out of the Wolf's Mouth\"); (3) in the Middle","Ages, the so-called Greek _Æsop_, ed. Halm, 276 _b_, really prose","versions of Babrius and \"Romulus,\" or prose of Phædrus, i. 8, also the","Romulus of Ademar (fl. 1030), 64; it occurs also on the Bayeux","Tapestry, in Marie de France, 7, and in Benedict of Oxford's _Mishle","Shualim_ (Heb.), 8; (4) Stainhöwel took it from the \"Romulus\" into his","German Æsop (1480), whence all the modern European Æsops are derived.","","_Remarks._--I have selected _The Wolf and the Crane_ as my typical","example in my \"History of the Æsopic Fable,\" and can only give here a","rough summary of the results I there arrived at concerning the fable,","merely premising that these results are at present no more than","hypotheses. The similarity of the Jataka form with that familiar to","us, and derived by us in the last resort from Phædrus, is so striking","that few will deny some historical relation between them. I conjecture","that the Fable originated in India, and came West by two different","routes. First, it came by oral tradition to Egypt, as one of the","Libyan Fables which the ancients themselves distinguished from the","Æsopic Fables. It was, however, included by Demetrius Phalereus,","tyrant of Athens, and founder of the Alexandrian library c. 300 B.C.,","in his _Assemblies of Æsopic Fables_, which I have shown to be the","source of Phædrus' Fables c. 30 A.D. Besides this, it came from","Ceylon in the Fables of Kybises--_i.e._, Kasyapa the Buddha--c. 50","A.D., was adapted into Hebrew, and used for political purposes, by","Rabbi Joshua ben Chananyah in a harangue to the Jews c. 120 A.D.,","begging them to be patient while within the jaws of Rome. The Hebrew","form uses the lion, not the wolf, as the ingrate, which enables us","to decide on the Indian _provenance_ of the Midrashic version. It may","be remarked that the use of the lion in this and other Jatakas is indirectly a testimony to their great age, as the lion has become","rarer and rarer in India during historic times, and is now confined","to the Gir forest of Kathiáwar, where only a dozen specimens exist,","and are strictly preserved.","","The verses at the end are the earliest parts of the Jataka, being in","more archaic Pali than the rest: the story is told by the commentator","(c. 400 A.D.) to illustrate them. It is probable that they were","brought over on the first introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon, c. 241","B.C. This would give them an age of over two thousand years, nearly","three hundred years earlier than Phædrus, from whom comes our _Wolf","and Crane_.","","","II. PRINCESS LABAM.","","_Source._--Miss Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales_, No. xxii. pp. 153-63,","told by Múniyá, one of the ayahs. I have left it unaltered, except","that I have replaced \"God\" by \"Khuda,\" the word originally used (see","Notes _l. c._, p. 237).","","_Parallels._--The tabu, as to a particular direction, occurs in other","Indian stories as well as in European folk-tales (see notes on Stokes, p.","286). The _grateful animals_ theme occurs in \"The Soothsayer's Son\"","(_infra_, No. x.), and frequently in Indian folk-tales (see Temple's","Analysis, III. i. 5-7; _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 412-3). The thorn in the","tiger's foot is especially common (Temple, _l. c._, 6, 9), and recalls the","story of Androclus, which occurs in the derivates of Phædrus, and may thus","be Indian in origin (see Benfey, _Panschatantra_, i. 211, and the parallels","given in my _Æsop_, Ro. iii. I. p. 243). The theme is, however, equally","frequent in European folk-tales: see my List of Incidents, _Proc. Folk-Lore","Congress_, p. 91, s.v. \"Grateful Animals\" and \"Gifts by Grateful Animals.\"","Similarly, the \"Bride Wager\" incident at the end is common to a large","number of Indian and European folk-tales (Temple, Analysis, p. 430; my","List, _l. c. sub voce_). The tasks are also equally common (_cf._ \"Battle","of the Birds\" in _Celtic Fairy Tales_), though the exact forms as given in","\"Princess Labam\" are not known in Europe.","","_Remarks._--We have here a concrete instance of the relation of Indian","and European fairy-tales. The human mind may be the same everywhere,","but it is not likely to hit upon the sequence of incidents, _Direction","tabu_--_Grateful Animals_--_Bride-wager_--_Tasks_, by accident, or","independently: Europe must have borrowed from India, or India from","Europe. As this must have occurred within historic times, indeed","within the last thousand years, when even European peasants are not","likely to have _invented_, even if they believed, in the incident of","the grateful animals, the probability is in favour of borrowing from","India, possibly through the intermediation of Arabs at the time of","the Crusades. It is only a probability, but we cannot in any case","reach more than probability in this matter, just at present.","","","III. LAMBIKIN.","","_Source._--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 69-72, originally","published in _Indian Antiquary_, xii. 175. The droll is common","throughout the Panjab.","","_Parallels._--The similarity of the concluding episode with the finish","of the \"Three Little Pigs\" (_Eng. Fairy Tales_, No. xiv.) In my notes","on that droll I have pointed out that the pigs were once goats or kids","with \"hair on their chinny chin chin.\" This brings the tale a stage","nearer to the Lambikin.","","_Remarks._--The similarity of Pig No. 3 rolling down hill in the churn","and the Lambikin in the Drumikin can scarcely be accidental, though,","it must be confessed, the tale has undergone considerable modification","before it reached England.","","","IV. PUNCHKIN.","","_Source._--Miss Frere, _Old Deccan Days_, pp. 1-16, from her ayah,","Anna de Souza, of a Lingaet family settled and Christianised at Goa","for three generations. I should perhaps add that a Prudhan is a Prime","Minister, or Vizier; Punts are the same, and Sirdars, nobles.","","_Parallels._--The son of seven mothers is a characteristic Indian","conception, for which see Notes on \"The Son of Seven Queens\" in this","collection, No. xvi. The mother transformed, envious stepmother, ring","recognition, are all incidents common to East and West;","bibliographical references for parallels may be found under these","titles in my List of Incidents. The external soul of the ogre has been","studied by Mr. E. Clodd in _Folk-Lore Journal_, vol. ii., \"The","Philosophy of Punchkin,\" and still more elaborately in the section,","\"The External Soul in Folk-tales,\" in Mr. Frazer's _Golden Bough_, ii.","pp. 296-326. See also Major Temple's Analysis, II. iii., _Wideawake","Stories_, pp. 404-5, who there gives the Indian parallels.","","_Remarks._--Both Mr. Clodd and Mr. Frazer regard the essence of the","tale to consist in the conception of an external soul or \"life-index,\"","and they both trace in this a \"survival\" of savage philosophy, which","they consider occurs among all men at a certain stage of culture. But","the most cursory examination of the sets of tales containing these","incidents in Mr. Frazer's analyses shows that many, indeed the","majority, of these tales cannot be independent of one another; for","they contain not alone the incident of an external materialised soul,","but the further point that this is contained in something else, which","is enclosed in another thing, which is again surrounded by a wrapper.","This Chinese ball arrangement is found in the Deccan (\"Punchkin\"); in","Bengal (Day, _Folk-Tales of Bengal_); in Russia (Ralston, p. 103","_seq._, \"Koschkei the Deathless,\" also in Mr. Lang's _Red Fairy","Book_); in Servia (Mijatovics, _Servian Folk-Lore_, p. 172); in South","Slavonia (Wratislaw, p. 225); in Rome (Miss Busk, p. 164); in Albania","(Dozon, p. 132 _seq._); in Transylvania (Haltrich, No. 34); in","Schleswig-Holstein (Müllenhoff, p. 404); in Norway (Asbjörnsen, No.","36, _ap._ Dasent, _Pop. Tales_, p. 55, \"The Giant who had no Heart in","his Body\"); and finally, in the Hebrides (Campbell, _Pop. Tales_, p.","10, _cf. Celtic Fairy Tales_, No. xvii., \"Sea Maiden\"). Here we have","the track of this remarkable idea of an external soul enclosed in a","succession of wrappings, which we can trace from Hindostan to the","Hebrides.","","It is difficult to imagine that we have not here the actual migration","of the tale from East to West. In Bengal we have the soul \"in a","necklace, in a box, in the heart of a _boal_ fish, in a tank\"; in","Albania \"it is in a pigeon, in a hare, in the silver tusk of a wild","boar\"; in Rome it is \"in a stone, in the head of a bird, in the head","of a leveret, in the middle head of a seven-headed hydra\"; in Russia","\"it is in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, in a casket, in an oak\"; in","Servia it is \"in a board, in the heart of a fox, in a mountain\"; in","Transylvania \"it is in a light, in an egg, in a duck, in a pond, in a","mountain\"; in Norway it is \"in an egg, in a duck, in a well, in a","church, on an island, in a lake\"; in the Hebrides it is \"in an egg, in","the belly of a duck, in the belly of a wether, under a flagstone on","the threshold.\" It is impossible to imagine the human mind","independently imagining such bizarre convolutions. They were borrowed","from one nation to the other, and till we have reason shown to the","contrary, the original lender was a Hindu. I should add that the mere","conception of an external soul occurs in the oldest Egyptian tale of","\"The Two Brothers,\" but the wrappings are absent.","","","V. THE BROKEN POT.","","_Source._--_Pantschatantra_, V. ix., tr. Benfey, ii. 345-6.","","_Parallels._--Benfey, in § 209 of his _Einleitung_, gives","bibliographical references to most of those which are given at length","in Prof. M. Müller's brilliant essay on \"The Migration of Fables\"","(_Selected Essays_, i. 500-76), which is entirely devoted to the","travels of the fable from India to La Fontaine. See also Mr.","Clouston, _Pop. Tales_, ii. 432 _seq._ I have translated the Hebrew","version in my essay, \"Jewish Influence on the Diffusion of","Folk-Tales,\" pp. 6-7. Our proverb, \"Do not count your chickens before","they are hatched,\" is ultimately to be derived from India.","","_Remarks._--The stories of Alnaschar, the Barber's fifth brother in","the _Arabian Nights_, and of La Perette, who counted her chickens","before they were hatched, in La Fontaine, are demonstrably derived","from the same Indian original from which our story was obtained. The","travels of the \"Fables of Bidpai\" from India to Europe are well known","and distinctly traceable. I have given a rough summary of the chief","critical results in the introduction to my edition of the earliest","English version of the _Fables of Bidpai_, by Sir Thomas North, of","Plutarch fame (London, D. Nutt, \"Bibliothèque de Carabas,\" 1888),","where I have given an elaborate genealogical table of the","multitudinous versions. La Fontaine's version, which has rendered the","fable so familiar to us all, comes from Bonaventure des Periers,","_Contes et Nouvelles_, who got it from the _Dialogus Creaturarum_ of","Nicholaus Pergamenus, who derived it from the _Sermones_ of Jacques de","Vitry (see Prof. Crane's edition, No. li.), who probably derived it","from the _Directorium Humanæ Vitæ_ of John of Capua, a converted Jew,","who translated it from the Hebrew version of the Arabic _Kalilah wa","Dimnah_, which was itself derived from the old Syriac version of a","Pehlevi translation of the original Indian work, probably called after","Karataka and Damanaka, the names of two jackals who figure in the","earlier stories of the book. Prof. Rhys-Davids informs me that these","names are more akin to Pali than to Sanskrit, which makes it still","more probable that the whole literature is ultimately to be derived","from a Buddhist source.","","The theme of La Perette is of interest as showing the _literary_","transmission of tales from Orient to Occident. It also shows the","possibility of an influence of literary on oral tradition, as is shown","by our proverb, and by the fact, which Benfey mentions, that La","Fontaine's story has had influence on two of Grimm's tales, Nos. 164,","168.","","","VI. THE MAGIC FIDDLE.","","_Source._--A. Campbell, _Santal Folk-Tales_, 1892, pp. 52-6, with some","verbal alterations. A Bonga is the presiding spirit of a certain kind","of rice land; Doms and Hadis are low-caste aborigines, whose touch is","considered polluting. The Santals are a forest tribe, who live in the","Santal Parganas, 140 miles N.W. of Calcutta (Sir W. W. Hunter, _The","Indian Empire_, 57-60).","","_Parallels._--Another version occurs in Campbell, p. 106 _seq._, which","shows that the story is popular among the Santals. It is obvious,","however, that neither version contains the real finish of the story,","which must have contained the denunciation of the magic fiddle of the","murderous sisters. This would bring it under the formula of _The","Singing Bone_, which M. Monseur has recently been studying with a","remarkable collection of European variants in the Bulletin of the","Wallon Folk-Lore Society of Liège (_cf. Eng. Fairy Tales_, No. ix.).","There is a singing bone in Steel-Temple's _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 127","_seq._ (\"Little Anklebone\").","","_Remarks._--Here we have another theme of the common store of European","folk-tales found in India. Unfortunately, the form in which it occurs","is mutilated, and we cannot draw any definite conclusion from it.","","","VII. THE CRUEL CRANE OUTWITTED.","","_Source._--The Baka-Jātaka, Fausböll, No. 38, tr. Rhys-Davids, pp.","315-21. The Buddha this time is the Genius of the Tree.","","[Illustration:]","","_Parallels._--This Jātaka got into the Bidpai literature, and","occurs in all its multitudinous offshoots (_see_ Benfey, _Einleitung_,","§ 60) among others in the earliest English translation by North (my","edition, pp. 118-22), where the crane becomes \"a great Paragone of","India (of those that liue a hundredth yeares and neuer mue their","feathers).\" The crab, on hearing the ill news \"called to Parliament","all the Fishes of the Lake,\" and before all are devoured destroys the","Paragon, as in the Jataka, and returned to the remaining fishes, who","\"all with one consent gave hir many a thanke.\"","","_Remarks._--An interesting point, to which I have drawn attention in","my Introduction to North's Bidpai, is the probability that the","illustrations of the tales as well as the tales themselves, were","translated, so to speak, from one country to another. We can trace","them in Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic MSS., and a few are extant on","Buddhist Stupas. Under these circumstances, it may be of interest to","compare with Mr. Batten's conception of the Crane and the Crab","(_supra_, p. 50) that of the German artist who illustrated the first","edition of the Latin Bidpai, probably following the traditional","representations of the MS., which itself could probably trace back to","India.","","","VIII. LOVING LAILI.","","_Source._--Miss Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales_, pp. 73-84. Majnun and","Laili are conventional names for lovers, the Romeo and Juliet of","Hindostan.","","_Parallels._--Living in animals' bellies occurs elsewhere in Miss","Stokes' book, pp. 66, 124; also in Miss Frere's, 188. The restoration","of beauty by fire occurs as a frequent theme (Temple, Analysis, III.","vi. f. p. 418). Readers will be reminded of the _dénouement_ of Mr.","Rider Haggard's _She_. Resuscitation from ashes has been used very","effectively by Mr. Lang in his delightful _Prince Prigio_.","","_Remarks._--The white skin and blue eyes of Prince Majnun deserve","attention. They are possibly a relic of the days of Aryan conquest,","when the fair-skinned, fair-haired Aryan conquered the swarthier","aboriginals. The name for caste in Sanskrit is _varna_, \"colour\"; and","one Hindu cannot insult another more effectually than by calling him a","black man. _Cf._ Stokes, pp. 238-9, who suggests that the red hair is","something solar, and derived from myths of the solar hero.","","","IX. THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN, AND THE JACKAL.","","_Source._--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 116-20; first","published in _Indian Antiquary_, xii. p. 170 _seq._","","_Parallels._--No less than 94 parallels are given by Prof. K. Krohn in","his elaborate discussion of this fable in his dissertation, _Mann und","Fuchs_, (Helsingfors, 1891), pp. 38-60; to which may be added three","Indian variants, omitted by him, but mentioned by Capt. Temple, _l.","c._, p. 324, in the _Bhâgavata Purâna_, the _Gul Bakâolî_ and _Ind.","Ant._ xii. 177; and a couple more in my _Æsop_, p. 253: add Smeaton,","_Karens_, p. 126.","","_Remarks._--Prof. Krohn comes to the conclusion that the majority of","the oral forms of the tale come from literary versions (p. 47),","whereas the _Reynard_ form has only had influence on a single variant.","He reduces the century of variants to three type forms. The first","occurs in two Egyptian versions collected in the present day, as well","as in Petrus Alphonsi in the twelfth century, and the _Fabulæ","Extravagantes_ of the thirteenth or fourteenth: here the ingrate","animal is a crocodile, which asks to be carried away from a river","about to dry up, and there is only one judge. The second is that","current in India and represented by the story in the present","collection: here the judges are three. The third is that current among","Western Europeans, which has spread to S. Africa and N. and S.","America: also three judges. Prof. K. Krohn counts the first the","original form, owing to the single judge and the naturalness of the","opening, by which the critical situation is brought about. The further","question arises, whether this form, though found in Egypt now, is","indigenous there, and if so, how it got to the East. Prof. Krohn","grants the possibility of the Egyptian form having been invented in","India and carried to Egypt, and he allows that the European forms have","been influenced by the Indian. The \"Egyptian\" form is found in Burmah","(Smeaton, _l. c._, p. 128), as well as the Indian, a fact of which","Prof. K. Krohn was unaware though it turns his whole argument. The","evidence we have of other folk-tales of the beast-epic emanating from","India improves the chances of this also coming from that source. One","thing at least is certain: all these hundred variants come ultimately","from one source. The incident \"Inside again\" of the _Arabian Nights_","(the Djinn and the bottle) and European tales is also a secondary","derivate.","","","X. THE SOOTHSAYER'S SON.","","_Source._--Mrs. Kingscote, _Tales of the Sun_ (p. 11 _seq._), from","Pandit Natesa Sastri's _Folk-Lore of Southern India_, pt. ii.,","originally from _Ind. Antiquary_. I have considerably condensed and","modified the somewhat Babu English of the original.","","_Parallels._--See Benfey, _Pantschatantra_, § 71, i. pp. 193-222, who","quotes the _Karma Jātaka_ as the ultimate source: it also occurs in","the _Saccankira Jātaka_ (Fausböll, No. 73), trans. Rev. R. Morris,","_Folk-Lore Jour._ iii. 348 _seq._ The story of the ingratitude of man","compared with the gratitude of beasts came early to the West, where it","occurs in the _Gesta Romanorum_, c. 119. It was possibly from an early","form of this collection that Richard Cœur de Lion got the story,","and used it to rebuke the ingratitude of the English nobles on his","return in 1195. Matthew Paris tells the story, _sub anno_ (it is an","addition of his to Ralph Disset), _Hist. Major_, ed. Luard, ii. 413-6,","how a lion and a serpent and a Venetian named Vitalis were saved from","a pit by a woodman, Vitalis promising him half his fortune, fifty","talents. The lion brings his benefactor a leveret, the serpent \"gemmam","pretiosam,\" probably \"the precious jewel in his head\" to which","Shakespeare alludes (_As You Like It_, ii. I., _cf._ Benfey, _l. c._,","p. 214, _n._), but Vitalis refuses to have anything to do with him,","and altogether repudiates the fifty talents. \"Hæc referebat Rex","Richardus munificus, ingratos redarguendo.\"","","_Remarks._--Apart from the interest of its wide travels, and its","appearance in the standard mediæval History of England by Matthew","Paris, the modern story shows the remarkable persistence of folk-tales","in the popular mind. Here we have collected from the Hindu peasant of","to-day a tale which was probably told before Buddha, over two thousand","years ago, and certainly included among the Jatakas before the","Christian era. The same thing has occurred with _The Tiger, Brahman,","and Jackal_ (No. ix. _supra_).","","","XI. HARISARMAN.","","_Source._--Somadeva, _Katha-Sarit-Sagara_, trans. Tawney (Calcutta,","1880), i. pp. 272-4. I have slightly toned down the inflated style of","the original.","","_Parallels _--Benfey has collected and discussed a number in _Orient","and Occident_, i. 371 _seq._; see also Tawney, _ad loc_. The most","remarkable of the parallels is that afforded by the Grimms' \"Doctor","Allwissend\" (No. 98), which extends even to such a minute point as his","exclamation, \"Ach, ich armer Krebs,\" whereupon a crab is discovered","under a dish. The usual form of discovery of the thieves is for the","Dr. Knowall to have so many days given him to discover the thieves,","and at the end of the first day he calls out, \"There's one of them,\"","meaning the days, just as one of the thieves peeps through at him.","Hence the title and the plot of C. Lever's _One of Them_.","","","XII. THE CHARMED RING.","","_Source._--Knowles, _Folk-Tales of Kashmir_, pp. 20-8.","","_Parallels._--The incident of the Aiding Animals is frequent in","folk-tales: see bibliographical references, _sub voce_, in my List of","Incidents, _Trans. Folk-Lore Congress_, p. 88; also Knowles, 21,","_n._; and Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 401, 412. The Magic Ring","is also \"common form\" in folk-tales; _cf._ Köhler _ap._ Marie de","France, _Lais_, ed. Warncke, p. lxxxiv. And the whole story is to be","found very widely spread from India (_Wideawake Stories_, pp. 196-206)","to England (_Eng. Fairy Tales_, No. xvii, \"Jack and his Golden","Snuff-box,\" _cf._ Notes, _ibid._), the most familiar form of it being","\"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp.\"","","_Remarks._--M. Cosquin has pointed out (_Contes de Lorraine_, p. xi.","_seq._) that the incident of the rat's-tail-up-nose to recover the","ring from the stomach of an ogress, is found among Arabs, Albanians,","Bretons, and Russians. It is impossible to imagine that","incident--occurring in the same series of incidents--to have been","invented more than once, and if that part of the story has been","borrowed from India, there is no reason why the whole of it should not","have arisen in India, and have been spread to the West. The English","variant was derived from an English Gipsy, and suggests the","possibility that for this particular story the medium of transmission","has been the Gipsies. This contains the incident of the loss of the","ring by the faithful animal, which again could not have been","independently invented.","","","XIII. THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE.","","[Illustration:]","","_Source._--The _Kacchapa Jātaka_, Fausböll, No. 215; also in his","_Five Jātakas_, pp. 16, 41, tr. Rhys-Davids, pp. viii-x.","","_Parallels._--It occurs also in the Bidpai literature, in nearly all","its multitudinous offshoots. See Benfey, _Einleitung_, §84; also my","_Bidpai_, E, 4 _a_; and North's text, pp. 170-5, where it is the","taunts of the other birds that cause the catastrophe: \"O here is a","brave sight, looke, here is a goodly ieast, what bugge haue we here,\"","said some. \"See, see, she hangeth by the throte, and therefor she","speaketh not,\" saide others; \"and the beast flieth not like a beast;\"","so she opened her mouth and \"pashte hir all to pieces.\"","","_Remarks._--I have reproduced in my edition the original illustration","of the first English Bidpai, itself derived from the Italian block.","A replica of it here may serve to show that it could be used","equally well to illustrate the Pali original as its English","great-great-great-great-great-great grand-child.","","","XIV. LAC OF RUPEES.","","_Source._--Knowles, _Folk-Tales of Kashmir_, pp. 32-41. I have reduced","the pieces of advice to three, and curtailed somewhat.","","_Parallels._--See _Celtic Fairy Tales_, No. xxii., \"Tale of Ivan,\"","from the old Cornish, now extinct, and notes _ibid._ Mr. Clouston","points out (_Pop. Tales_, ii. 319) that it occurs in Buddhist","literature, in \"Buddaghoshas Parables,\" as \"The Story of Kulla","Pauthaka.\"","","_Remarks._--It is indeed curious to find the story better told in","Cornwall than in the land of its birth, but there can be little doubt","that the Buddhist version is the earliest and original form of the","story. The piece of advice was originally a charm, in which a youth","was to say to himself, \"Why are you busy? Why are you busy?\" He does","so when thieves are about, and so saves the king's treasures, of which","he gets an appropriate share. It would perhaps be as well if many of","us should say to ourselves \"_Ghatesa, ghatesa, kim kárana?_\"","","","XV. THE GOLD-GIVING SERPENT.","","_Source._--_Pantschatantra_, III. v., tr. Benfey, ii. 244-7.","","_Parallels_ given in my _Æsop_, Ro. ii. 10, p. 40. The chief points","about them are--(1) though the tale does not exist in either Phædrus","or Babrius, it occurs in prose derivates from the Latin by Ademar, 65,","and \"Romulus,\" ii. 10, and from Greek, in Gabrias, 45, and the prose","_Æsop_, ed.

THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS.","","_Source._--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 98-110, originally","published in _Ind. Antiq._ x. 147 _seq._","","_Parallels._--A long variant follows in _Ind.

The","\"letter to kill bearer\" and \"letter substituted\" are frequent in both","European (see my List _s. v._) and Indian Folk-Tales (Temple,","Analysis, II. iv. _b_, 6, p. 410). The idea of a son of seven mothers","could only arise in a polygamous country. It occurs in \"Punchkin,\"","_supra_, No. iv.; Day, _Folk-Tales of Bengal_, 117 _seq._; _Ind.","Antiq._ i. 170 (Temple, _l. c._, 398).","","_Remarks._--M. Cosquin (_Contes de Lorraine_, p. xxx.) points out how,","in a Sicilian story, Gonzenbach (_Sizil. Mähr._ No. 80), the seven","co-queens are transformed into seven step-daughters of the envious","witch who causes their eyes to be taken out. It is thus probable,","though M. Cosquin does not point this out, that the \"envious","step-mother\" of folk-tales (see my List, _s. v._) was originally an","envious co-wife. But there can be little doubt of what M.

A LESSON FOR KINGS.","","_Source._--_Rājovāda Jātaka_, Fausböll, No. 151, tr.","Rhys-Davids, pp. xxii.-vi.","","_Remarks._--This is one of the earliest of moral allegories in","existence.

The moves of the men are decided by the","throws of a long form of dice. The object of the game is to see which","of the players can first move all his men into the black centre square","of the cross (Temple, _l. c._, p. 344, and _Legends of Panjab_, i.","243-5). It is sometimes said to be the origin of chess.","","_Parallels._--Rev. C. Swynnerton, \"Four Legends about Raja Rasalu,\" in","_Folk-Lore Journal_, p. 158 _seq._, also in separate book much","enlarged, _The Adventures of Raja Rasalu_, Calcutta, 1884. Curiously","enough, the real interest of the story comes after the end of our part","of it, for Kokilan, when she grows up, is married to Raja Rasalu, and","behaves as sometimes youthful wives behave to elderly husbands. He","gives her her lover's heart to eat, _à la_ Decameron, and she dashes","herself over the rocks. For the parallels of this part of the legend","see my edition of Painter's _Palace of Pleasure_, tom. i. Tale 39, or,","better, the _Programm_ of H. Patzig, _Zur Geschichte der Herzmäre_","(Berlin, 1891). Gambling for life occurs in Celtic and other","folk-tales; _cf._ my List of Incidents, _s. v._ \"Gambling for Magic","Objects.\"","","_Remarks._--Raja Rasalu is possibly a historic personage, according to","Capt. Temple, _Calcutta Review_, 1884, p. 397, flourishing in the","eighth or ninth century. There is a place called Sirikap ka-kila in","the neighbourhood of Sialkot, the traditional seat of Rasalu on the","Indus, not far from Atlock.","","Herr Patzig is strongly for the Eastern origin of the romance, and","finds its earliest appearance in the West in the Anglo-Norman","troubadour, Thomas' _Lai Guirun_, where it becomes part of the Tristan","cycle. There is, so far as I know, no proof of the earliest part of","the Rasalu legend (_our_ part) coming to Europe, except the existence","of the gambling incidents of the same kind in Celtic and other","folk-tales.","","","XX. THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.","","_Source._--The _Sīha Camma Jātaka_, Fausböll, No. 189, trans.","Rhys-Davids, pp. v. vi.","","_Parallels._--It also occurs in Somadeva, _Katha Sarit Sagara_, ed.","Tawney, ii. 65, and _n_.

Ellis, 5, whence it came into the modern","Æsop.","","_Remarks._--Avian wrote towards the end of the third century, and put","into Latin mainly those portions of Babrius which are unparalleled by","Phædrus. Consequently, as I have shown, he has a much larger","proportion of Eastern elements than Phædrus. There can be little doubt","that the Ass in the Lion's Skin is from India. As Prof. Rhys-Davids","remarks, the Indian form gives a plausible motive for the masquerade","which is wanting in the ordinary Æsopic version.","","","XXI.

Prof. Benfey, in an elaborate dissertation (\"Die","Kluge Dirne,\" in _Ausland_, 1859, Nos. 20-25, now reprinted in _Kl.","Schr._ ii. 156 _seq._), has shown the wide spread of the theme both in","early Indian literature (though probably there derived from the folk)","and in modern European folk literature.","","","XXV. THE DEMON WITH THE MATTED HAIR.","","_Source._--The _Pancāvudha-Jātaka_, Fausböll, No. 55, kindly","translated for this book by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, of Christ's College,","Cambridge. There is a brief abstract of the Jataka in Prof. Estlin","Carpenter's sermon, _Three Ways of Salvation_, 1884, p. 27, where my","attention was first called to this Jataka.","","_Parallels._--Most readers of these Notes will remember the central","episode of Mr. J. C. Harris' _Uncle Remus_, in which Brer Fox, annoyed","at Brer Rabbit's depredations, fits up \"a contrapshun, what he calls a","Tar Baby.\" Brer Rabbit, coming along that way, passes the time of day","with Tar Baby, and, annoyed at its obstinate silence, hits it with","right fist and with left, with left fist and with right, which","successively stick to the \"contrapshun,\" till at last he butts with","his head, and that sticks too, whereupon Brer Fox, who all this time","had \"lain low,\" saunters out, and complains of Brer Rabbit that he is","too stuck up. In the sequel Brer Rabbit begs Brer Fox that he may","\"drown me as deep ez you please, skin me, scratch out my eyeballs,","t'ar out my years by the roots, en cut off my legs, but do don't fling","me in dat brier patch;\" which, of course, Brer Fox does, only to be","informed by the cunning Brer Rabbit that he had been \"bred en bawn in","a brier patch.\" The story is a favourite one with the negroes: it","occurs in Col. Jones' _Negro Myths of the Georgia Coast_ (Uncle Remus","is from S. Carolina), also among those of Brazil (Romero, _Contos do","Brazil_), and in the West Indian Islands (Mr. Lang, \"At the Sign of","the Ship,\" _Longman's Magazine_, Feb. 1889). We can trace it to","Africa, where it occurs in Cape Colony (_South African Folk-Lore","Journal_, vol. i.).","","_Remarks._--The five-fold attack on the Demon and the Tar Baby is so","preposterously ludicrous that it cannot have been independently","invented, and we must therefore assume that they are causally","connected, and the existence of the variant in South Africa clinches","the matter, and gives us a landing-stage between India and America.","There can be little doubt that the Jataka of Prince Five Weapons came","to Africa, possibly by Buddhist missionaries, spread among the","negroes, and then took ship in the holds of slavers for the New World,","where it is to be found in fuller form than any yet discovered in the","home of its birth. I say Buddhist missionaries, because there is a","certain amount of evidence that the negroes have Buddhistic symbols","among them, and we can only explain the identification of Brer Rabbit","with Prince Five Weapons, and so with Buddha himself, by supposing the","change to have originated among Buddhists, where it would be quite","natural. For one of the most celebrated metempsychoses of Buddha is","that detailed in the _Sasa Jātaka_ (Fausböll, No. 316, tr. R.","Morris, _Folk-Lore Journal_, ii. 336), in which the Buddha, as a hare,","performs a sublime piece of self-sacrifice, and as a reward is","translated to the moon, where he can be seen to this day as \"the hare","in the moon.\" Every Buddhist is reminded of the virtue of","self-sacrifice whenever the moon is full, and it is easy to understand","how the Buddha became identified as the Hare or Rabbit. A striking","confirmation of this, in connection with our immediate subject, is","offered by Mr. Harris' sequel volume, _Nights with Uncle Remus_. Here","there is a whole chapter (xxx.) on \"Brer Rabbit and his famous Foot,\"","and it is well known how the worship of Buddha's foot developed in","later Buddhism. No wonder Brer Rabbit is so 'cute: he is nothing less","than an incarnation of Buddha. Among the Karens of Burmah, where","Buddhist influence is still active, the Hare holds exactly the same","place in their folk-lore as Brer Rabbit among the negroes. The sixth","chapter of Mr. Smeaton's book on them is devoted to \"Fireside","Stories,\" and is entirely taken up with adventures of the Hare, all of","which can be parallelled from _Uncle Remus_.","","Curiously enough, the negro form of the five-fold attack--\"fighting","with _five_ fists,\" Mr. Barr would call it--is probably nearer to the","original legend than that preserved in the Jataka, though 2000 years","older. For we may be sure that the thunderbolt of Knowledge did not","exist in the original, but was introduced by some Buddhist Mr. Barlow,","who, like Alice's Duchess, ended all his tales with: \"And the moral of","that is----\" For no well-bred demon would have been taken in by so","simple a \"sell\" as that indulged in by Prince Five-Weapons in our","Jataka, and it is probable, therefore, that _Uncle Remus_ preserves a","reminiscence of the original Indian reading of the tale. On the other","hand, it is probable that Carlyle's Indian god with the fire in his","belly was derived from Prince Five-Weapons.","","The negro variant has also suggested to Mr. Batten an explanation of","the whole story which is extremely plausible, though it introduces a","method of folk-lore exegesis which has been overdriven to death. The","_Sasa Jātaka_ identifies the Brer Rabbit Buddha with the hare in","the moon. It is well known that Easterns explain an eclipse of the","moon as due to its being swallowed up by a Dragon or Demon. May not,","asks Mr. Batten, the _Pancavudha Jātaka_ be an idealised account of","an eclipse of the moon? This suggestion receives strong confirmation","from the Demon's reference to Rahu, who does, in Indian myth swallow","the moon at times of eclipse. The Jataka accordingly contains the","Buddhist explanation why the moon--_i.e._ the hare in the moon, _i.e._","Buddha--is not altogether swallowed up by the Demon of Eclipse, the","Demon with the Matted Hair. Mr. Batten adds that in imagining what","kind of Demon the Eclipse Demon was, the Jataka writer was probably","aided by recollections of some giant octopus, who has saucer eyes and","a kind of hawk's beak, knobs on its \"tusks,\" and a very variegated","belly (gasteropod). It is obviously unfair of Mr. Batten both to","illustrate and also to explain so well the Tar Baby Jataka--taking the","scientific bread, so to speak, out of a poor folk-lorist's mouth--but","his explanations seem to me so convincing that I cannot avoid","including them in these Notes.","","I am, however, not so much concerned with the original explanation of","the Jataka as to trace its travels across the continents of Asia,","Africa, and America. I think I have done this satisfactorily, and will","have thereby largely strengthened the case for less extensive travels","of other tales. I have sufficient confidence of the method employed to","venture on that most hazardous of employments, scientific prophecy. I","venture to predict that the Tar Baby story will be found in Madagascar","in a form nearer the Indian than Uncle Remus, and I will go further,","and say that it will _not_ be found in the grand Helsingfors","collection of folk-tales, though this includes 12,000, of which 1000","are beast-tales.","","","XXVI. THE IVORY PALACE.","","_Source._--Knowles, _Folk-Tales of Kashmir_, pp. 211-25, with some","slight omissions. Gulizar is Persian for rosy-cheeked.","","_Parallels._--Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales_, No. 27. \"Panwpatti Rani,\"","pp. 208-15, is the same story. Another version in the collection","_Baital Pachisi_, No. 1.","","_Remarks._--The themes of love by mirror, and the faithful friend, are","common European, though the calm attempt at poisoning is perhaps","characteristically Indian, and reads like a page from Mr. Kipling.","","","XXVII. SUN, MOON, AND WIND.","","_Source._--Miss Frere, _Old Deccan Days_, No. 10, pp. 153-5.","","_Remarks._--Miss Frere observes that she has not altered the","traditional mode of the Moon's conveyance of dinner to her mother the","Star, though it must, she fears, impair the value of the story as a","moral lesson in the eyes of all instructors of youth.","","","XXVIII. HOW WICKED SONS WERE DUPED.","","_Source._--Knowles. _Folk-Tales of Kashmir_, pp. 241-2.","","_Parallels._--A Gaelic parallel was given by Campbell in _Trans.","Ethnol. Soc._, ii. p. 336; an Anglo-Latin one from the Middle Ages by","T. Wright in _Latin Stories_ (Percy Soc.), No. 26; and for these and","points of anthropological interest in the Celtic variant see Mr.","Gomme's article in _Folk-Lore_, i. pp. 197-206, \"A Highland Folk-Tale","and its Origin in Custom.\"","","_Remarks._--Mr. Gomme is of opinion that the tale arose from certain","rhyming formulæ occurring in the Gaelic and Latin tales as written on","a mallet left by the old man in the box opened after his death. The","rhymes are to the effect that a father who gives up his wealth to his","children in his own lifetime deserves to be put to death with the","mallet. Mr. Gomme gives evidence that it was an archaic custom to put","oldsters to death after they had become helpless. He also points out","that it was customary for estates to be divided and surrendered during","the owners' lifetime, and generally he connects a good deal of","primitive custom with our story. I have already pointed out in","_Folk-Lore_, p. 403, that the existence of the tale in Kashmir without","any reference to the mallet makes it impossible for the rhymes on the","mallet to be the source of the story. As a matter of fact, it is a","very embarrassing addition to it, since the rhyme tells against the","parent, and the story is intended to tell against the ungrateful","children. The existence of the tale in India renders it likely enough","that it is not indigenous to the British Isles, but an Oriental","importation. It is obvious, therefore, that it cannot be used as","anthropological evidence of the existence of the primitive customs to","be found in it. The whole incident, indeed, is a striking example of","the dangers of the anthropological method of dealing with folk-tales","before some attempt is made to settle the questions of origin and","diffusion.","","","XXIX. THE PIGEON AND THE CROW.","","_Source._--The _Lola Jātaka_, Fausböll, No. 274, kindly translated","and slightly abridged for this book by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse.","","_Remarks._--We began with an animal Jataka, and may appropriately","finish with one which shows how effectively the writers of the Jatakas","could represent animal folk, and how terribly moral they invariably","were in their tales. I should perhaps add that the Bodhisat is not","precisely the Buddha himself but a character which is on its way to","becoming perfectly enlightened, and so may be called a future Buddha.","","","","","","*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK INDIAN FAIRY TALES ***","","","    ","","Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will","be renamed.","","Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright","law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,","so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United","States without permission and without paying copyright","royalties.
